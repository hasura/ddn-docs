### ObjectType

Definition of a user-defined Open DD object type.

**Properties**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `name` | `string` | Yes | The name to give this object type, used to refer to it elsewhere in the metadata. Must be unique across all types defined in this subgraph. |
| `fields` | [`array`](#fielddefinition) | Yes | The list of fields defined for this object type. |
| `globalIdFields` | `array,null` | No | The subset of fields that uniquely identify this object in the domain. Setting this property will automatically implement the GraphQL Relay Node interface for this object type and add an `id` global ID field. If setting this property, there must not be a field named `id` already present. |
| `graphql` | [`object`](#objecttypegraphqlconfiguration) | No | Configuration for how this object type should appear in the GraphQL schema. |
| `description` | `string,null` | No | The description of the object. Gets added to the description of the object's definition in the graphql schema. |


**Example:**

```yaml
name: Author
fields:
  - name: author_id
    type: Int!
    description: The id of the author
  - name: first_name
    type: String
    description: The first name of the author
  - name: last_name
    type: String
    description: The last name of the author
globalIdFields:
  - author_id
graphql:
  typeName: Author
  inputTypeName: null
description: An author of a book

```


#### ObjectFieldDefinition

The definition of a field in a user-defined object type.



**Properties**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the field. This name is used both when referring to the field elsewhere in the metadata and when creating the corresponding GraphQl type. |
| `type` | `string` | Yes | The type of this field. This uses the GraphQL syntax to represent field types and must refer to one of the inbuilt OpenDd types or another user-defined type. |
| `description` | `string,null` | No | The description of this field. Gets added to the description of the field's definition in the graphql schema. |


#### ObjectTypeGraphQLConfiguration

GraphQL configuration of an Open DD object type.



**Properties**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `typeName` | `string` | Yes | The name to use for the GraphQL type representation of this object type when used in an output context. |
| `inputTypeName` | `string` | Yes | The name to use for the GraphQL type representation of this object type when used in an input context. |


#### TypeReference

A reference to an Open DD type including nullable values and arrays.
Suffix '!' to indicate a non-nullable reference, and wrap in '[]' to indicate an array.
Eg: '[String!]!' is a non-nullable array of non-nullable strings.
