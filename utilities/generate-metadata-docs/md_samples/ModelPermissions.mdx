| `modelName` | `string` | Yes | The name of the model for which permissions are being defined. |
| `permissions` | [`array`](#modelpermission) | Yes | A list of model permissions, one for each role. |

```yaml
modelName: Articles
permissions:
  - role: admin
    select:
      filter: null
  - role: user
    select:
      filter:
        fieldComparison:
          field: author_id
          operator: _eq
          value:
            sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id

```


#### ModelPermission

Defines the permissions for an OpenDD model.



**Properties**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `role` | `string` | Yes | The role for which permissions are being defined. |
| `select` | [`object`](#selectpermission) | No | The permissions for selecting from this model for this role. If this is null, the role is not allowed to query the model. |


**Example:**

```yaml
role: user
select:
  filter:
    fieldComparison:
      field: author_id
      operator: _eq
      value:
        sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id

```


#### SelectPermission

Defines the permissions for selecting a model for a role.



**Properties**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `filter` | `object` | Yes | Filter expression when selecting rows for this model. Null filter implies all rows are selectable. |


#### ModelPredicate

A predicate that can be used to restrict the objects returned when querying a model.



**This object must have exactly one of the following:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `fieldComparison` | `object` | No | Field comparision predicate filters objects based on a field value. |
| `fieldIsNull` | `object` | No |  |
| `relationship` | `object` | No | Relationship predicate filters objects of a source model based on a predicate on the related model. |
| `And` | `array` | No | Evaluates to true if all sub-predicates evaluate to true. |
| `Or` | `array` | No | Evaluates to true if any of the sub-predicates evaluate to true. |
| `Not` | `object` | No | A predicate that can be used to restrict the objects returned when querying a model. |


**Example:**

```yaml
fieldComparison:
  field: author_id
  operator: _eq
  value:
    sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id

```


#### FieldComparisonPredicate

Field comparision predicate filters objects based on a field value.



**Properties**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `field` | `string` | Yes | The field name of the object type of the model to compare. |
| `operator` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operator to use for comparison. |
| `value` | [`object`](#valueexpression) | Yes | The value expression to compare against. |


#### RelationshipPredicate

Relationship predicate filters objects of a source model based on a predicate on the related model.



**Properties**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the relationship of the object type of the model to follow. |
| `predicate` | [`object`](#modelpredicate) | No | The predicate to apply on the related objects. If this is null, then the predicate evaluates to true as long as there is at least one related object present. |


#### ValueExpression

An expression which evaluates to a value that can be used in permissions.



**This object must have exactly one of the following:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `Literal` | `object` | No |  |
| `SessionVariable` | `string` | No | Used to represent the name of a session variable, like "x-hasura-role". |
