# Private DDN

With Private deployment for Hasura DDN, you can run Hasura and your connectors either on dedicated infrastructure hosted
by Hasura or on your own infrastructure. In both cases, Hasura's automated systems will be managing the infrastructure
ensuring uptime and reliability.

Private Hasura DDN offers enhanced security and isolation by enabling private connectivity for your databases, APIs, and
other connectors. Hasura communicates with your sources over a dedicated private network, bypassing the public internet.
