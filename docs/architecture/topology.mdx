# Topology

## Introduction

Hasura DDN is a fully managed SaaS product where your API is running on the cloud, where performance, availability and
security is already taken care of for you. Your API will be running on Hasura's optimized serverless production
infrastructure.

For organizations with advanced security and compliance needs, Hasura DDN can be deployed within isolated compute and
network infrastructure hosted with a cloud provider and their regions that you choose. Private deployment of Hasura DDN
enables secure connectivity to your data sources, whether they are within your Cloud VPCs or on-prem infrastructure. You
can also configure the API to be exposed over internal IP alone. Advanced firewalll rules and API protections are
available.

Hasura Private DDN is available as a dedicated offering that is fully hosted and managed by Hasura. It 
can be deployed to your own cloud provider account in a Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) model, where it is still completely
managed by Hasura.

## Hasura DDN

When you create a project on Hasura DDN, your GraphQL API is running on global serverless edge infrastructure hosted by
Hasura. You configure your instance to talk to your databases, APIs, or other connectors that are hosted on your
infrastructure and Hasura communicates with them over the public internet.

With serverless-edge deployment, Hasura and your connectors operate within Hasura's infrastructure. We manage automatic
scaling, provisioning, operations, and maintenance.

This deployment option is production-ready, with the API available **instantly**. There is no base cost: it is free if
you are on the Free plan, or you only pay for the [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) if you're on the Base or
Advanced plans. For more details, visit our [pricing page](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).

## Hasura Private DDN

Hasura Private DDN provides all the benefits of Hasura DDN with the added advantage of private data connectivity and
isolated infrastructure. We highly recommend Private DDN for any organization using Hasura DDN to connect to private 
data, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure and is protected from vulnerabilities associated with public networks.

With Private DDN, the Data Plane is running on Dedicated Infrastructure which provides dedicated network and compute 
infrastructure for your deployment, offering superior security by isolating traffic from public networks and other
customers. Highest level of isolation provided by the cloud providers is used to make sure that the workloads are
dedicated to the customer.

Private Data Source Connectivity enables direct, secure, and private connections to data sources without relying on
public networks, minimizing latency and enhancing data protection. With Private DDN, VPC peering, VPN, Private Link
or any other cloud vendor specific technology is available.

Single Sign-On (SAML) with Private DDN enables effortless and secure access by integrating with identity providers 
like Okta or Active Directory. 
Custom Firewall Rules allows organizations to define custom rules, controlling network traffic flow based on specific
security policies. Private DDN also gives customers Private API Endpoints (For Internal network use) that are restricted
to internal networks, ensuring external traffic cannot access your data or applications.

## Multi-region

Hasura DDN is deployed over many regions around the globe. This deployment model provides lowest latency possible to
your API clients. The API endpoint that Hasura DDN provides is backed by an Anycast IP address, where a single IP is
allocated for serving the incoming request and the request is routed to the nearest Hasura DDN region.

Combined with multi-region databases, Hasura DDN gives you the best performance for your APIs, without the hassle of
setting up any of this infrastructure yourself. Read more about how this works on
