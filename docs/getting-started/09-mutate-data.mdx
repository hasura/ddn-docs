# Mutate Data

## What's about to happen?

You can easily write data to your database using the native driver of your data source and the TypeScript connector. You
can follow the steps below to create a function which manipulates or inserts data and is exposed as a mutation via your
GraphQL API.

:::tip Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you've connected, prepared, and started your TypeScript connector. Details can be found
[here](/getting-started/07-integrate-business-logic.mdx).

## Steps

<DatabaseContentLoader />

## What did this do?

This function created a mutation that we can use to insert data directly into our database. We utilized raw SQL to
leverage the native features of PostgreSQL directly from our TypeScript function. While the example above is used to
insert data, you can use the same principles to modify or delete existing data in your database via your GraphQL API.

If you've followed along to this point, you've seen what Hasura can do and are ready to deploy your supergraph. Head to
the [deployment section](/getting-started/deployment/index.mdx) to learn how to deploy connectors and your supergraph.
