# Mutate Data

## What's about to happen?

You can easily write data to your database using the native driver of your data source and the TypeScript connector. You
can follow the steps below to create a function which manipulates or inserts data and is exposed as a mutation via your
GraphQL API.

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/getting-started/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- A configured [TypeScript connector](/getting-started/integrate-business-logic.mdx)

:::

<DatabaseContentLoader />

## Next steps

If you've followed along to this point, you've seen what Hasura can do and are ready to deploy your supergraph. Head to
the [deployment section](/getting-started/deployment/index.mdx) to learn how to deploy connectors and your supergraph.
