# Get Started with Hasura DDN and PostgreSQL

<Prereqs />

## Guide

In this guide, you'll learn how to get started with Hasura DDN and a PostgreSQL database. You'll set up a new Hasura DDN
project, connect it to a PostgreSQL database, and run your first query. This guide assumes you're starting from scratch,
but you can easily follow the steps if you already have data seeded; Hasura will never modify your source schema.

:::info Don't have your own PostgreSQL instance?

The `hasura/postrgres` data connector ships with a built-in PostgreSQL image for you to get up-and-running quickly. Skip
ahead to [Step 2](#step-2) and — after initializing your connector in [Step 4](#step-4) — come back to create this table
and seed data.

:::

### Step 1. Create a table in your PostgreSQL database

```sql title="First, you'll create a new table in your PostgreSQL database:"
--- Create the table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL
);

--- Insert some data
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 25);
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Bob', 30);
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Charlie', 35);
```

:::tip Connect to cloud local data sources

Hasura DDN can connect to hosted or local data sources. If you have a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL provider, you can connect
to your database and seed the table with the above data. Alternatively, you can
[run PostgreSQL locally using Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

:::

### Step 2. Authenticate your CLI {#step-2}

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

### Step 3. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, you'll create a new local project. Run the following command:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

### Step 4. Initialize your PostgreSQL connector {#step-4}

```sh title="Initialize a new PostgreSQL connector. Run the following command:"
ddn connector init my_pg -i
```

From the dropdown, start typing `PostgreSQL` and hit enter.

Set your environment variables:

| Variable         | Value                                                                                                      | Required |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `CONNECTION_URI` | The connection string to your source in this format: `postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/dbname` | Yes      |
| `CLIENT_CERT`    | Path to the client certificate file.                                                                       | No       |
| `CLIENT_KEY`     | Path to the client key file.                                                                               | No       |
| `ROOT_CERT`      | Path to the root certificate file.                                                                         | No       |

:::info Connecting a local database?

Hasura DDN uses a unique domain to resolve local services when using Docker. In the connection string above, you can
replace `hostname` with `local.hasura.dev` if you're connecting to a local database running inside of a Docker
container.

:::

### Step 5. Introspect your PostgreSQL database

```sh title="Next, you'll introspect your PostgreSQL database:"
ddn connector introspect my_pg
```

### Step 6. Add your model

```sh title="Now, you'll track the tables as models in your PostgreSQL database:"
ddn models add my_pg users
```

:::info Have multiple tables?

You can quickly grab them all using:

```sh
ddn models add my_pg "*"
```

:::

### Step 7. Create a new build

```sh title="Next, you'll create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

### Step 8. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and PostgreSQL connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 9. Run your first query

```sh title="Open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="And, if you write a query like this:"
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    age
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 25
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": 30
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Charlie",
        "age": 35
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a Hasura DDN project and connected it to a PostgreSQL database. Next, you
can explore more advanced features like [relationships](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx),
[permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx), and more.

Take a look at our [PostgreSQL connector](https://hasura.io/connectors/postgres) to learn more about how to use Hasura
DDN with PostgreSQL.
