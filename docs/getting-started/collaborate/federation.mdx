# Onboard Teams

## Introduction

:::info Only available on DDN Advanced

In order to add subgraph collaborators, your project must be a [DDN Advanced project](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).

:::

Hasura DDN provides a concept of [subgraph](/project-configuration/subgraphs/#introduction) which allows you to manage
your Hasura metadata more efficiently by allowing it to be split based on ownership. Hasura DDN allows multiple users
and teams to [work together as collaborators](/getting-started/collaborate/invite.mdx) on subgraphs by assigning each
user specific roles and permissions.

In this guide, you'll learn how to onboard multiple teams into a collaborative project using a supergraph. This approach
allows for efficient collaboration making it easier to manage and scale your project as more teams are added.

## Collaboration Scenario

Let's imagine an example with two teams: The Fulfillment Team and the UX team, and you as the supergraph admin. The
Fulfillment Team is responsible for products and orders, whereas the UX handles everything related to users.

| Team | Name        | Responsibilities |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1    | Fulfillment | Products, Orders |
| 2    | UX          | Users            |

The Fulfillment team is already using Hasura DDN and has created a supergraph project with their Products and Orders
[models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) enabled.

When the UX Team joins the project, you'll use the [CLI](/cli/installation.mdx) to create a new subgraph for them, named
`ux` and [invite developers](/getting-started/collaborate/invite.mdx) from the team to collaborate on this subgraph via
the console.

The UX team will start by initializing a new local DDN project with their own new version control repository and set the
project context to match the existing project set up by the Fulfillment team.

The UX team will then set up their data connector in their subgraph, track the `Users` model, deploy the connector, then
create and apply a new subgraph build which will be added to the supergraph.

The UX team can also add relationships and permissions in their that integrate with the Fulfillment team's existing
subgraphs too.

This process can be easily repeated for any additional teams, allowing each team to contribute their models and features
while maintaining a cohesive project structure with a distributed workflow.

## Workflow

### Steps for supergraph admin

#### Step 1. Create a new subgraph

Using the CLI, create a new subgraph on your DDN project.

```bash title="In a project directory, run the following:"
ddn project subgraph create <subgraph-name>
```

#### Step 2. Invite collaborators

[Follow the steps](/getting-started/collaborate/invite.mdx#invite-collaborators) to invite subgraph collaborators. Take
care to select the appropriate role — either **Admin** or **Developer** — for each subgraph team member.

### Steps for subgraph collaborators

#### Step 1. Accept the invite

[Reference these docs](/getting-started/collaborate/invite.mdx#accept-invite) to accept an invitation and explore the
existing supergraph.

#### Step 2. Create a new local project

To get started with local development on your subgraph, create a new local project and specify the name of the subgraph
which was created by the supergraph admin for you.

```bash title="Run the following in a new directory for your project:"
ddn supergraph init . --create-subgraph  <subgraph-name>
```

With Hasura DDN, we understand that each team may have their own unique workflows and design patterns, so each team can
create a new repository for their new project; there is no need for all subgraphs to live in the same repository as the
existing supergraph.

#### Step 3. Set the project context

Using the CLI, set the project's context by passing its name to the following command.

```bash
ddn project init --with-project <project-name>
```

It's recommended to set up subgraph GraphQL prefixes at this point.

#### Step 4. Add a data connector and track your models

You can add a new [native data connector](/connectors/overview.mdx) to your subgraph using the CLI. Data connectors are
what allow you to integrate various data sources to your API.

In the following sequence, we'll do a few things:

- Initialize a new data connector, which will allow you to connect a data source to your API.
- Introspect the source and create a configuration that your connector understands and can use to generate Hasura
  metadata.
- Track all the entities in your data source as either [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) or
  [commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx), which will then be available via your API.

```bash title="Run this command and follow the prompts for your connector:"
ddn connector init my_connector -i
```

```bash title="Then, introspect your data source to generate configuration files:"
ddn connector introspect my_connector
```

```bash title="Finally, track all your resources:"
ddn model add '*'
ddn command add '*'
ddn relationship add '*'
```

#### Step 5. Build and run locally

Build your supergraph locally and run it using Docker Compose:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
```

Run with docker compose:

```
ddn run docker-start
```

#### Step 6. Initialize the DDN project with context

You can now initialize the project on DDN with the context of the existing project.

```bash
ddn project init --with-project <project-name>
```

#### Step 7. Create a supergraph build

Create a new supergraph build:

```bash
ddn supergraph build create
```

#### Step 8. Deploy your subgraph changes

When you're satisfied with the state of your supergraph after testing the subgraph changes, apply the supergraph build:

```bash
ddn subgraph build apply <build-id>
```

:::info To apply a build Only subgraph admins or supergraph admins can apply a subgraph build. :::
