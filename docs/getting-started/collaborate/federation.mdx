# Onboard Teams

## Introduction

:::info Only available on DDN Advanced

In order to add subgraph collaborators, your project must be a [DDN Advanced project](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).

:::

Hasura DDN provides a concept of [subgraph](/project-configuration/subgraphs/#introduction) which allows you to manage
your Hasura metadata more efficiently by allowing it to be split based on ownership. Hasura DDN allows multiple users
and teams to work together as collaborators on subgraphs by assigning each user specific roles and permissions.

In this guide, you'll learn how to onboard multiple teams into a collaborative project using a supergraph. This approach
allows for efficient collaboration, streamlined data integration, and a cohesive project structure, making it easier to
manage and scale your project as more teams are added.

## Collaboration Scenario

Let's imagine an example with two teams: The Fulfillment Team and the UX team, and you as the supergraph admin. The
Fulfillment Team is responsible for products and orders, whereas the UX handles everything related to users.

| Team | Name        | Responsibilities |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| 1    | Fulfillment | Products, Orders |
| 2    | UX          | Users            |

The Fulfillment team is already using Hasura DDN and has created a supergraph project with their Products and Orders
[models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) enabled.

When the UX Team joins the project, you'll use the CLI to create a new subgraph for them, named
`ux` and invite developers from the team to collaborate on this subgraph via the console.

The UX team will start by initializing their local project in their chosen repository and set the project
context to match the existing project set up by the Fulfillment team.

The UX team will set up their data connector in their subgraph, track their Users model, deploy the connector, and
create and apply a new subgraph build.

The UX team can add relationships and permissions that integrate with the Fulfillment team's subgraphs too.

This process can be easily repeated for any additional teams, allowing each team to contribute their models and features
while maintaining a cohesive project structure. As the supergraph admin, you'll ensure a smooth and efficient onboarding
process for every team.

## Workflow

### Steps for supergraph admin

#### Step 1. Create a new subgraph

Using the CLI, create a new subgraph on your DDN project.

```bash title="In a project directory, run the following:"
ddn project subgraph create <subgraph-name>
```

#### Step 2. Invite collaborators

Follow the steps [here](/getting-started/collaborate/invite.mdx#how-to-invite-collaborators) to invite subgraph
collaborators. Take care to select the appropriate role — either **subgraph admin** or **subgraph developer** — for each
team member.

### Steps for subgraph collaborators

#### Step 1. Accept the invite

Reference [these docs](/getting-started/collaborate/invite.mdx#how-to-accept-a-collaboration-invite) to accept an invite
and explore the existing supergraph.

#### Step 2. Create a new local project

To get started with local development, you'll need to create a new local project.

With Hasura DDN, we understand teams have established workflows and design patterns. You can create this project in any
repository; there is no need for it to live in the same repository as the existing supergraph.

```bash title="Run the following:"
ddn project init .
```

In the next step, we'll map this local project to the existing cloud project.

#### Step 3. Set the project context

Using the CLI, set the project's context by passing its name to the following command.

```bash title="Pass the cloud project's name of the existing supergraph:"
ddn context set project <project-name>
```

#### Step 4. Create a new subgraph

You'll need to create a subgraph in your local metadata that matches the name of the subgraph created in the cloud
project by your supergraph admin. This ensures proper mapping between the metadata you generate and what is eventually
served by your cloud project.

```bash title="Create a subgraph matching the name of the subgraph provisioned for you by the supergraph admin:"
ddn subgraph init <subgraph-name> --dir <subgraph-name>
```

```bash title="Then, add the new subgraph to your supergraph's configuration file:"
ddn subgraph add --subgraph another_subgraph/subgraph.yaml --target-supergraph ./supergraph.yaml
```

#### Step 5. Add a data connector and track your models

You can add a new [native data connector](/connectors/overview.mdx) to your subgraph using the CLI. Data connectors are
what allow you to integrate various data sources to your API.

In the following sequence, we'll do a few things:

- Initialize a new data connector, which will allow you to connect a data source to your API.
- Introspect the source and create a configuration that your connector understands and can use to generate Hasura
  metadata.
- Track all of the entities in your data source as either [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) or
  [commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx), which will then be available via your API.

```bash title="Run this command and follow the prompts for your connector:"
ddn connector init -i
```

```bash title="Then, introspect your data source to generate configuration files:"
ddn connector introspect <connector-name-from-previous-step>
```

```bash title="Finally, track all your resources:"
ddn connector-link add-resources "*"
```

:::info Run your supergraph locally

At this point, you can run the following command — with any adjustments made to the `--env-file` path — to start your
supergraph and data connector:

```bash
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat) docker compose --env-file .env up --build --watch
```

**Note: You'll only see your subgraph available locally. This is becuase your local supergraph only contains your
subgraph. You are free to iterate on it and make changes without causing disruption to other subgraphs or downstream
consumers. To test your subgraph within the project's supergraph, follow the next steps.**

:::

#### Step 6. Deploy the connector

You'll need to deploy the connector so its availalbe in your cloud project.

#### Step 7. Test and apply the build

Finally, you'll need to create a new build.

:::info To apply a build

Only subgraph admins or supergraph admins can apply a subgraph build.
