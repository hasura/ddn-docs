# Invite Collaborators

## Introduction

Hasura DDN allows multiple users and teams to work together as collaborators on projects by assigning each user specific
roles and permissions.

:::info Only available on DDN Base and higher

In order to add collaborators, your project must either be a
[DDN Base or DDN Advanced project](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).

:::

## Available roles

| Role  | Abilities                                                                                           |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Owner | All Project abilities including deletion. **At this time, project ownership is not transferrable.** |
| Admin | Same as a project owner, excluding deletion.                                                        |

## How to invite collaborators

### Step 1. Navigate to the Collaborators section

Open your project's console at [https://console.hasura.io](https://console.hasura.io) and select it from the list of
available projects. Once the project is open, click `Settings` in the bottom-left corner and then select `Collaborators`
from the `Project Settings` menu:

### Step 2. Enter information

Click the `+ Add Collaborator` button in the top-right corner of the `Collaborators` section and enter the
collaborator's email address and select their role:

The invitee will receive an email with a link allowing them to accept the invite and join the project.

## How to accept a collaboration invite

### Step 1. Click the link in your email

From your email, click the `View invitation` button. This will send you to
[https://console.hasura.io](https://console.hasura.io) where you can accept it and then explore and contribute to the
project.

### Step 2. Explore the project

From your new project, you can explore the console by:

- [Running queries](/graphql-api/queries/) from the GraphiQL explorer.
- Visualizing the supergraph with the Explorer tab.
- Seeing other collaborators present in the project.

### Step 3. Learn how to develop locally

The owner of the project most likely has a Git repository with the project's contents available on a service such as
GitHub. To run the supergraph locally, and make contributions to the deployed supergraph,
[pick up here](/getting-started/build/build-your-api) in our getting started docs.
