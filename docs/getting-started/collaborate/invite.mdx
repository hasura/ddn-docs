# Invite Collaborators

## Introduction

Hasura DDN allows multiple users and teams to work together as collaborators on projects by assigning each user specific
roles and permissions.

You can [invite users](#invite-collaborators) to a project, or allow them to [request access](#request-access).

:::info Only available on DDN Base and higher

In order to add collaborators, your project must either be a
[DDN Base or DDN Advanced project](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).

## How to invite collaborators {#invite-collaborators}

### Step 1. Navigate to the Collaborators section

Open your project's console at [https://console.hasura.io](https://console.hasura.io) and select it from the list of
available projects. Once the project is open, click `Settings` in the bottom-left corner and then select `Collaborators`
from the `Project Settings` menu:

### Step 2. Enter information

Click the `+ Invite Collaborator` button in the top-right corner of the `Collaborators` section and enter the
collaborator's email address, supergraph or subgraph access level and select their role, and, for subgraph access,
their roles per subgraph.

:::info Subgraph Collaborators Only available on DDN Advanced

In order to add subgraph collaborators, your project must be a [DDN Advanced project](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).

:::

The invitee will receive an email with a link allowing them to accept the invite and join the project.

## How to accept a collaboration invite {#accept-invite}

### Step 1. Click the link in your email

From your email, click the `View invitation` button. This will send you to
[https://console.hasura.io](https://console.hasura.io) where you can accept it and then explore and contribute to the
project according your [role](#roles).

### Step 2. Explore the project

From your new project, you can explore the console by:

- [Running queries](/graphql-api/queries/) from the GraphiQL explorer.
- Visualizing the supergraph with the Explorer tab.
- Seeing other collaborators present in the project.

### Step 3. Learn how to develop locally

The owner of the project most likely has a Git repository with the project's contents available on a service such as
GitHub. To run the supergraph locally, and make contributions to the deployed supergraph,
[pick up here](/getting-started/build/build-your-api) in our getting started docs.

## Allow users to request access {#request-access}

You can adjust your project's settings to allow users to request access when navigating to your project's URL. To do
this, click the `Share` button in the top navigation of your project and select `Request Access`.

Each time a user requests access, you'll be able to approve or deny the request from this modal.
