# Commenting on Metadata

## Introduction

Hasura DDN provides a commenting feature that allows your API producers and consumers to start conversations directly on
the API metadata. This feature enhances collaboration by closing the feedback loop and helps teams communicate more
effectively about their API design and implementation.

:::tip Getting Access

You can add comments on various objects from your metadata.

1. Navigate to any model page in your project via the `Explorer` tab.
