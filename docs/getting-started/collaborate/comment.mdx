# Comment on Models

## Introduction

Hasura DDN provides a powerful commenting feature that allows API producers and consumers to start conversations
directly on the schema. This feature enhances collaboration and helps teams communicate more effectively about their API
design and implementation.

## How to Comment

1. Navigate to any model page in your project.
2. Hover over the field or section you want to comment on.
3. Click on the comment icon that appears.

2. Select the collaborator you want to notify.

Tagged collaborators will receive an email with your comments, keeping them informed of any discussions or questions.
