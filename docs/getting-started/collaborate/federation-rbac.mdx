# Invite Subgraph Collaborator

## Introduction

Hasura DDN provides a concept of
[subgraph](/project-configuration/subgraphs/#introduction)
which allows you to manage your Hasura metadata more efficiently by allowing it
to be split based on ownership.

Hasura DDN allows multiple users and teams to work together as collaborators on
subgraphs by assigning each user specific roles and permissions.

:::info Only available on DDN Advanced

In order to add collaborators, your project must be a [DDN Advanced
project](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).

## Available roles

| Role                | Abilities                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Subgraph Admin      | All subgraph related abilities: create subgraph build, apply subgraph build to endpoint, create supergraph with subgraph patch, invite other subgraph admins.  |
| Subgraph Developer  | Same as a subgraph admin, excluding the ability to invite others and apply subgraph build to endpoint                                                          |

## How to invite collaborators

### Step 1. Navigate to the Collaborators section

Open your project's console at
[https://console.hasura.io](https://console.hasura.io) and select it from the
list of available projects. Once the project is open, click `Settings` in the
bottom-left corner and then select `Collaborators` from the `Project Settings`
menu:

### Step 2. Enter information

Click the `+ Add Collaborator` button in the top-right corner of the
`Collaborators` section and select the `+ Add Subgraph Collaborator` button.
Here you can enter the collaborator's email address and select the subgraphs you
want to give them access to:

The invitee will receive an email with a link allowing them to accept the invite and join the project.

## How to accept a collaboration invite

### Step 1. Click the link in your email

From your email, click the `View invitation` button. This will send you to
[https://console.hasura.io](https://console.hasura.io) where you can accept it
and then explore and contribute to the project.

### Step 2. Explore the project

From your new project, you can explore the console by:

- [Running queries](/graphql-api/queries/) from the GraphiQL explorer.
- Visualizing the supergraph with the Explorer tab.
- Seeing other collaborators present in the project.

### Step 3. Learn how to develop locally

The owner of the project most likely has a Git repository with the project's
contents available on a service such as GitHub. To run the subgraph locally,
and make contributions to the deployed supergraph, [pick up
here](/getting-started/build/build-your-api) in our getting started docs.
