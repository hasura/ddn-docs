# Quickstart with DDN

This guide will help you create a new local Hasura DDN supergraph in only a couple of minutes.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the DDN CLI

<InstallTheCli />

2. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), which will be used for local development. This helps you
   iterate and develop locally without deploying any changes to Hasura DDN, making the development experience faster and
   your feedback loops shorter. **You'll need Docker Compose `v2.27.1` or later.**

<Step
language="bash"
code={`ddn supergrpah init .`}
>

## Initialize a new supergraph in an empty directory

The `ddn supergraph init` command initializes a supergraph by setting up all necessary files and directories for both
local and cloud development.

When executed, it creates a `build` directory containing JSON configurations, a Docker compose file, and VS Code helper
files. This setup allows you to start and manage your supergraph services locally with Docker. You can specify a
directory for initialization using the `--dir` flag.

</Step>

<Step
language="bash"
code={`ddn connector init`}
>

## Initialize a data connector

The `ddn connector init` command adds a new data connector to your supergraph project.

When you run this command, you'll be prompted to select a data connector from a dropdown menu. You'll then need to
provide a name for the connector, choose a free port for it to use, and — if applicable — enter the connection URI.

</Step>

<Step
language="bash"
code={`ddn connector introspect my_connector`}
>

## Introspect the data connector

The `ddn connector introspect` command will introspect your data source to create a configuration file describing your
data source in a format which the connector specifies.

This configuration will then be used by the CLI to create representations of your data source in your API.

</Step>

<Step
language="bash"
code={`ddn model track "*"`}
>

## Track all models

The `ddn model track` command allows you to track models in your supergraph.

Models serve as the link between your data source's collections — such as tables — and the types exposed in your GraphQL
API.

</Step>

<Step
language="bash"
code={`ddn supergraph build local`}
>

## Build your supergraph

The `ddn supergraph build local` command will create a local build of your supergraph.

This allows you to create an API which you can run locally and test before pushing your changes to version control or
creating a deploying a cloud build, either on Hasura DDN or on your own self-hosted infrastructure.

</Step>

<Step
language="bash"
code={`HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat) docker compose up --build --watch`}
>

## Start your supergraph

Start your local supergraph using Docker and by passing your Hasura DDN PAT as an environment variable.

This allows you to make authenticated requests. You can explore, visualize, and test your supergraph using the Hasura
DDN console. Simply head to `https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql` and try it out!
