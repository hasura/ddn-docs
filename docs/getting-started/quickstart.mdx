## Prerequisites

<InstallTheCli />

<Step
id="login"
language="bash"
code={`ddn auth login`}
heading={`Log in via the CLI`}
>

The `ddn auth login` command will authenticate your CLI session, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

When you run this command, a browser window will open, allowing you to login to Hasura Cloud. After a successful login,
you'll be redirected to your CLI session and can proceed with creating your supergraph.

</Step>

<Step
id="supergraph-init"
language="bash"
code={`mkdir hasura_project && cd hasura_project\nddn supergraph init .`}
heading={`Initialize a new supergraph in an empty directory`}
>

The `ddn supergraph init` command initializes a supergraph — which is a composite API — by setting up all necessary
files and directories for development.

When you execute this command, the CLI creates a Docker Compose file and a .env file to run the Hasura engine locally
and other configuration files describing your supergraph. Additionally, the CLI creates two
[subgraphs](/project-configuration/subgraphs.mdx), `globals` and `app`, to get you started with building your API. This
setup allows you to start and manage your supergraph services locally with Docker.

</Step>

<Step
id="connector-init"
language="bash"
code={`ddn connector init my_connector -i`}
heading={`Connect to data`}
>

The `ddn connector init` command adds a new native data connector to your supergraph project.

[Data connectors](/connectors/overview.mdx) allow you to connect to a specific type of data source (such as PostgreSQL,
MongoDB, MySQL, ClickHouse, etc.).

Here we're naming our connector `my_connector` which is referenced in subsequent commands. As we are running this
command with the interactive flag (`-i`), you'll be prompted to select a data connector type and enter any required
environment variables, such as the connection details of your data source. The CLI will then generate the connector
related files and also add a [DataConnectorLink](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx) metadata object to link
your connector to the supergraph.

**Don't have a data source at hand?**

You can choose our `hasura/postgres` connector which by default connects to our sample Postgres database for you to
explore. Or check [this guide](/connectors/postgresql/local-postgres.mdx) to set up a local Postgres database using
Docker.

</Step>

<Step
id="connector-introspect"
language="bash"
code={`ddn connector introspect my_connector`}
heading={`Introspect your data source`}
>

The `ddn connector introspect` command will introspect your data source.

This creates a set of configuration files describing your data source in a format which the connector specifies. It also
updates the corresponding DataConnectorLink with the resources from the data source that can be exposed via the API.
This will then be used in the next step to generate metadata for each resource found during introspection.

</Step>

<Step
id="add-resources"
language="bash"
code={`ddn model add my_connector '*'\nddn relationship add my_connector '*'`}
heading={`Add your resources`}
>

This will create metadata for [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx), [commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx),
and [relationships](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx) in your supergraph. Metadata configures your GraphQL API and
exposes entities in your data sources — such as tables.

</Step>

<Step
id="build-local"
language="bash"
code={`ddn supergraph build local`}
heading={`Build your supergraph for the local engine`}
>

The `ddn supergraph build local` command will build your supergraph and create local assets to run the engine.

This allows you to create an immutable build of your API which you can run locally and test before pushing your changes
to version control or creating and deploying a cloud build, either on Hasura DDN or on your own self-hosted
infrastructure.

</Step>

<Step
id="run-local"
language="bash"
code={`ddn run docker-start`}
heading={`Start your supergraph`}
>

The `ddn run docker-start` command will execute the script found in your `.hasura/context.yaml` file.

When you run this command, Docker will start services for your supergraph, each connector you've added, and
observability tools.

You can explore, visualize, and test your supergraph using the Hasura DDN console. Simply run `ddn console --local` or
head to [`https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql`](https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql?url=http://localhost:3000)
and try it out!

**Congratulations! At this point, you've created your very first, fully-functioning supergraph 🎉**

Next, lets deploy your supergraph to Hasura DDN. Note that your data source will need to be accessible from the internet
to be able to connect to it from Hasura DDN.

</Step>

<Step
id="project-init"
language="bash"
code={`ddn project init`}
heading={`Create a Hasura DDN project`}
>

The `ddn project init` command will provision a new project on Hasura DDN to deploy your supergraph.

The CLI will also create a `.env.cloud` file based on your `.env` file that contains any environment variables necessary
to run your supergraph, such as the connection string to a data source. It will also set the project's name in your
local context so you can run simplified commands. Finally, the CLI will generate your `globals` and `app` subgraphs on
your Hasura DDN project.

</Step>

<Step
id="build-create"
language="bash"
code={`ddn supergraph build create`}
heading={`Build and deploy your supergraph`}
>

Running `ddn supergraph build create` will build your data connector and the supergraph, making your API available on
Hasura DDN.

This command builds each data connector associated with the project, updates any environment variables to match the
connectors' URLs, and creates a new immutable build of your supergraph. You can explore this build on the
[DDN console](https://console.hasura.io/). And, when ready, you can
[apply the build](/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_apply.mdx) so it's served by your project's API endpoint.

**That's it! you've created your very first, fully-functioning supergraph and deployed it to Hasura DDN 🎉**

</Step>

## Next steps

What we've laid out above is the quickest way to get started with Hasura DDN. However, you have complete, granular
control over each step in the process and can extend and customize your supergraph to fit your teams' needs. After
deploying your first supergraph, check out these sections to see what your supergraph can do!

### Integrate custom business logic

We've revolutionized how custom business logic is integrated into an API with our lambda connectors for TypeScript and
Python. Gone are the days of writing separate microservices to handle business logic; with Hasura DDN, you can write
your custom functions and expose them directly via your API! Plus, you get all the benefits of the supergraph, including
the ability to add relationships and permissions for each function. Check it out
[here](/getting-started/build/06-add-business-logic.mdx).

### Add authorization

You can quickly and easily create access-control rules for any entity in your supergraph using
[permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx). Learn how to add ModelPermissions to control row-level access, and
TypePermissions to control which columns are exposed to specific user roles. You can check both out in
[this guide](/getting-started/build/05-add-permissions.mdx).

### Iterate on your API

In your day-to-day development cycle, you will be making changes to your data source's schema while developing new
features. When this happens, you'll need to update your Hasura metadata to bring those changes into your API. Check out
how to iterate on your API [here](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/02-create-source-metadata.mdx).

### Create relationships across sources

Arguably, the biggest benefit of a GraphQL API is your ability to create nested queries that allow you to return data
from multiple tables and — with Hasura DDN — multiple sources. With Hasura DDN's metadata-driven approach, you can
easily author relationships, using our
[VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura), linking together disparate
data sources for efficient, elegant queries to power your modern applications. Learn how
[here](/getting-started/build/07-create-a-relationship.mdx).

### Add new subgraphs

Hasura DDN makes it easy to collaborate and iteratively build a federated API using individual subgraphs. Subgraphs can
be owned by specific teams and their metadata can even live in separate repositories, ensuring discrete ownership rules
are honored. Learn how to add new subgraphs to your supergraph [here](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx).
