# Create a Subgraph

A [**Subgraph**](/project-configuration/subgraphs.mdx) allows you to define a part of your Supergraph
completely separately from the rest of it.

This is useful to maintain a logical separation of concerns and/or to allow different teams to work on different
parts of the Supergraph at the same time without stepping on each other's toes.

Usually, a subgraph is "owned" and maintained by a team that owns the data source, (or more broadly "data domain")
that it connects to. And usually, one data domain is allocated to one subgraph.

  <h2>Subgraph independence</h2>
  Subgraphs have their own permission model and own development lifecycles separate to that of the supergraph. They
  can be developed, tested, and built independently while the supergraph guarantees the integrity of the subgraph
  composition. Meaning that the supergraph will only build if all subgraphs are in a valid state.

  A subgraph is analogous to a microservice owned by a particular team.

  Subgraphs can reference each other, allowing, for example, the creation of relationships between them.
  <h2>Naming</h2>
  Let's say we're in an organisation and the data source we'll be connecting to is for customer
  profile data. The team responsible for this data and some services related to it is called the "Customer Data" team.

  As such, we could create a `customer_data_team` subgraph, reflecting the team's name, indicating that they're the ones
  who will be working on it, or to be more specific, we could name it `customer_profile` to reflect the data domain.

  Another example, if we're working with a data source for a small project which we plan on using to contain all the
  data for our whole project, at least for the time being, and it's all in PostgreSQL, we could name it
  `postgres_data`, to keep it simple. This one subgraph would contain all the data domain specific metadata for the
  whole project.

In the directory you've created your supergraph, run the following command to create a subgraph:

```bash
ddn subgraph init <subgraph-name>
```

The CLI will respond with a success message.
