# Create a Subgraph

## What's about to happen?

We're going to add a subgraph to our supergraph.

A [**subgraph**](/project-configuration/subgraphs.mdx) is a way of organizing your data and allows you to connect data
sources to your supergraph. A supergraph must have at least one subgraph, at least if you want it to do anything. ðŸ˜‰

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed](/getting-started/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/01-init-supergraph.mdx)

:::

Creating a subgraph is simple.

```bash title="At the root of your project, run:"
ddn subgraph init my_subgraph
```

The CLI will respond with a success message (and a hint to add a connector to the subgraph).

You can read more about appropriate [subgraph naming](#naming) below.

## What did this do?

This command creates a sub-directory within your supergraph directory, named after the subgraph you specified. Inside
this new sub-directory, it also creates an empty `.env.my_subgraph` file.

It also added an object including your new subgraph in the `subgraphs` section of your `supergraph.yaml` file, which is
the configuration file for your supergraph and can be found in the root of your project's directory.

However, without a data connector in our subgraph it's just a placeholder right now...which doesn't do much.

### Subgraph independence

Subgraphs are used to maintain a logical separation of concerns and/or to allow different teams to work on different
parts of the supergraph at the same time without stepping on each other's toes. Usually, a subgraph is "owned" and
maintained by a team that is responsible for the data source, or more broadly: "data domain", that it connects to. And
by convention, one data domain is allocated to one subgraph. A subgraph is analogous to a microservice owned by a
particular team.

When we talk about data domains, we're talking about the collection of data and operations for one area of the business,
or team within the business. This could be a single database, a set of databases, a database and business logic, some
other 3rd party APIs, or a combination of all of these.

Subgraphs can reference each other, allowing, for example, the creation of relationships between them.

The supergraph is the composition of all subgraphs and their relationships, but it does not care how the metadata is
structured or organized into directories. That is up to the developer. The supergraph only cares that all metadata is
valid and can be compiled into an API build.

Subgraphs have their own permission models and development lifecycles separate to that of the supergraph. They can be
developed, tested, and built independently while the supergraph guarantees the integrity of subgraph composition.
Meaning that the supergraph will only build, and generate an API if all subgraphs are in a valid state. In this Getting
Started section we propose best-practice for organizing your subgraphs, but it can be done however you choose.

### Naming

Let's say we're in an organization and the data source we'll be connecting to is for customer profile data. The team
responsible for this data and some services related to it is called the "Customer Data" team. As such, we could create a
`customer_data_team` subgraph, reflecting the team's name, indicating that they're the ones who will be working on it.
Or, we could choose to be more specific and name it `customer_profile` to reflect the data domain itself, if multiple
teams are going to work on it.

Another example is, if we're working with a data source for a small project which we plan on using to contain all the
data for our whole project, and it's all in PostgreSQL, with some business logic in TypeScript, we could name it
`postgres_data`, or `app` to keep it simple. This one subgraph would contain all the data domain specific metadata for
the whole project, at least for the time being.

## Next steps

We now have a subgraph to which we can 
[include and configure a data connector](/getting-started/connect-to-data/index.mdx). Data connectors will enable you to
connect external data sources to your supergraph.
