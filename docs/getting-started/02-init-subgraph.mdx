# Create a Subgraph

[**Subgraphs**](/project-configuration/subgraphs.mdx) are mapped to specific data domains within an organization. For
example, if the PostgreSQL database which we'll be connecting in the next step is for customer profile data, it's a safe
bet that the team responsible for this — and other data sources — is our User Experience team. As such, we could create
a `ux` subgraph that will integrate this database (and possibly others) into our API using this command with the project
name from the previous step:

```bash
ddn project subgraph create <desired-subgraph-name> --project <project-name>
```

The CLI will respond with your new subgraph's name.
