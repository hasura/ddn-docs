# Create a Subgraph

## What's about to happen?

We're going to add a subgraph to our supergraph.

A [**subgraph**](/project-configuration/subgraphs.mdx) is a way of organizing your data and allows you to connect data
sources to your supergraph. A supergraph must have at least one subgraph.

## Steps

:::tip Required

- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/01-init-supergraph.mdx)

:::

**Inside your existing supergraph directory**, run the following command to create a Subgraph:

```bash
ddn subgraph init <subgraph-name>
```

The CLI will respond with a success message.

## What did this do?

This command created a directory in your supergraph directory with the subgraph name you provided with an empty
`.env.<subgraph-name>` file in it.

It also added an object including your new subgraph in the `subgraphs` section of your `supergraph.yaml` file, which is
the configuration file for your supergraph.

```yaml
kind: Supergraph
version: v1
definition:
  supergraph_globals:
    generator:
      rootPath: ./supergraph
    envFile: ./supergraph/.env.supergraph
    includePaths:
      - ./supergraph/auth-config.hml
      - ./supergraph/compatibility-config.hml
      - ./supergraph/graphql-config.hml
  # highlight-start
  subgraphs:
    my-subgraph:
      generator:
        rootPath: my-subgraph/metadata
      envFile: my-subgraph/.env.my-subgraph
      includePaths:
        - my-subgraph
# highlight-end

  <h2>Subgraph independence</h2>

Subgraphs are used to maintain a logical separation of concerns and/or to allow different teams to work on different
parts of the supergraph at the same time without stepping on each other's toes. Usually, a subgraph is "owned" and
maintained by a team that owns the data source, (or more broadly "data domain") that it connects to. And by convention,
one data domain is allocated to one subgraph.

Subgraphs have their own permission model and own development lifecycles separate to that of the supergraph. They can be
developed, tested, and built independently while the supergraph guarantees the integrity of subgraph composition.
Meaning that the supergraph will only build, and generate an API if all subgraphs are in a valid state.

A subgraph is analogous to a microservice owned by a particular team.

When we talk about data domains, we're talking about the collection of data and operations for one area of the business
or team within the business. This could be a single database, a set of databases, a database and business logic, some
other 3rd party APIs, or a combination of all of these.

Subgraphs can reference each other, allowing, for example, the creation of relationships between them.

The supergraph is the composition of all subgraphs and their relationships but it does not care how they are structured
or organised into directories. That is up to the developer. The supergraph only cares that all metadata is valid and can
be compiled and built into an API. In this getting started section we propose best-practice for organising your
subgraphs, but it can be done however you choose.

<h2>Naming</h2>
Let's say we're in an organisation and the data source we'll be connecting to is for customer profile data. The team responsible
for this data and some services related to it is called the "Customer Data" team. As such, we could create a `customer_data_team`
subgraph, reflecting the team's name, indicating that they're the ones who will be working on it. Or we could choose to be
more specific, we could name it `customer_profile` to reflect the data domain.

Another example, if we're working with a data source for a small project which we plan on using to contain all the data
for our whole project and it's all in PostgreSQL, we could name it `postgres_data`, to keep it simple. This one subgraph
would contain all the data domain specific metadata for the whole project.

## Next steps

We now have a subgraph to which we can add a
[include and configure a data connector](/getting-started/connect-to-data/index.mdx). Data connectors will enable you to
connect external data sources to your supergraph.
