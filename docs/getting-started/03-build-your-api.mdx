# Build your API & Query Data

## Step 1. Create a supergraph build

Next, we'll create our first supergraph build. We'll pass the `local` subcommand along with specifying the output
directory as `./engine` in the root of the project. This directory is used by the docker-compose file to serve the
engine locally:

```bash
ddn-staging supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

You can now navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) and interact with your API using the GraphiQL
playground!

<!-- The CLI will respond with information about our project, including a link to the project's console. Click on that to see -->
<!-- the GraphiQL explorer and interact with your API. -->

## Step 2. Write your first query

For example, if we have a `Carts` model, we can run the following query:

```graphql
query AllCartsQuery {
  ux_carts {
    id
    isComplete
    userId
  }
}
```

All types are namespaced with the subgraph to which they belong. Here, you can see that `carts` belongs to the `ux`
subgraph. Thus, the query above will return a response that looks like this:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/beta/console_simple-carts-query.png" alt="Simple query with carts" width="1000px" />

:::tip Want to import every table and foreign-key relationship?

You can run the following instead of atomically adding models to your API:

```bash
ddn connector-link update mypg --add-all-resources
```
