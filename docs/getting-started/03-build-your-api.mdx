# Build your API & Make Queries

## What's about to happen?

After [connecting a data source](/getting-started/connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx) and
[exposing a model](/getting-started/connect-to-data/03-add-source-entities.mdx), we'll create a new local build of
our API.

A build is a compiled, immutable state of your metadata which the Hasura Engine uses to run your API.

When you execute the command below, the CLI will create a new build for your supergraph. You'll then be able to execute
a GraphQL query on your API using any models you've added.

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- At least one [subgraph](/getting-started/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- At least one [data connector running](/getting-started/connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx)
- [Models added](/getting-started/connect-to-data/03-add-source-entities.mdx) to your subgraph

:::

### Step 1. Create a supergraph build

Pass the `local` subcommand along with specifying the output directory as `./engine` in the root of the project. This
directory is used by the docker-compose file to serve the engine locally:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

This will create a build of your supergraph.

:::tip Start your engines!

Want to test your supergraph? Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine and connectors using the following command:

```bash
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn internal print-pat) docker compose -f docker-compose.hasura.yaml watch
```

:::

You can now navigate to
[`https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql?url=http://localhost:3000`](https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql?url=http://localhost:3000)
and interact with your API using the Hasura Console.

### Step 2. Write your first query

For example, if we have a `Carts` model, we can run the following query:

```graphql
query MyFirstQuery {
  app_carts {
    id
    isComplete
    userId
  }
}
```

All types are namespaced with the subgraph to which they belong. Here, you can see that `carts` belongs to a
subgraph named `app`. Thus, the query above will return a response that looks like this:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/beta/console_simple-carts-query.png" alt="Simple query with carts" width="1000px" />

:::info Query names

In GraphQL, you can provide a name for your query, which in this example is `MyFirstQuery`. This name is customizable by
you at query time and just helps with logging and debugging.

## What did this do?

When you executed the command above, the CLI used the Hasura metadata in your directory - generated based on your data
source(s) — to create a local build of your supergraph. This local build is immutable and can be used to test the
changes to your API before either making more changes or, eventually, creating a build on Hasura DDN.

Next, we recommend learning how easy it is to [add authorization rules](/getting-started/06-add-permissions.mdx), which
limit a user's access to data, using permissions.

## Next steps

Now that you have a build of your supergraph you can do a lot more with it. Here are some suggestions to allow you
to jump around the Getting Started section according to your interests:
- [Deploy to cloud](/getting-started/deployment/index.mdx) to make your API available to the world
- [Add permissions](/getting-started/06-add-permissions.mdx) to your models
- [Create relationships](/getting-started/08-create-a-relationship.mdx) between models
- [Mutate your data](/getting-started/09-mutate-data.mdx) with Hasura DDN
