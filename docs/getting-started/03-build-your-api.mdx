# Build your API & Query Data

## What's about to happen?

After [connecting a data source](/getting-started/connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx) and
[exposing a model](/getting-started/connect-to-data/03-expose-source-entities.mdx), you can now build your API locally.
When you execute the command below, the CLI will create a new build for your supergraph. You'll then be able to execute
a GraphQL query on your API.

## Steps

### Step 1. Create a supergraph build

Pass the `local` subcommand along with specifying the output directory as `./engine` in the root of the project. This
directory is used by the docker-compose file to serve the engine locally:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

This will create a build and start the GraphQL engine.

You can now navigate to [`https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql`](https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql) and
interact with your API using the Hasura Console!

### Step 2. Write your first query

For example, if we have a `Carts` model, we can run the following query:

```graphql
query AllCartsQuery {
  app_carts {
    id
    isComplete
    userId
  }
}
```

All types are namespaced with the subgraph to which they belong. Here, you can see that `carts` belongs to the `app`
subgraph. Thus, the query above will return a response that looks like this:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/beta/console_simple-carts-query.png" alt="Simple query with carts" width="1000px" />

:::tip Want to import every table and foreign-key relationship?

You can run the following instead of atomically adding models to your API:

```bash
ddn connector-link update mypg --add-all-resources
```

:::

## What did this do?

When you executed the command above, the CLI used the Hasura metadata in your directory - generated based on your data
source(s) â€” to create a local build of your supergraph. This local build is immutable and can be used to test the
changes to your API before either making more changes or, eventually, creating a build on Hasura DDN.

Next, we recommend learning how easy it is to add authorization rules, which limit a user's access to data, using
permissions.
