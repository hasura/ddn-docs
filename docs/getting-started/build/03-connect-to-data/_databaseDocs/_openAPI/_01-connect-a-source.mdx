## What's about to happen?

You can easily and quickly connect any API defined in the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) spec format to your
Supergraph.

To do this, we use the Hasura [OpenAPI Lambda data connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-open-api-lambda) to
facilitate the connection. Then, with the Hasura CLI, we introspect the OpenAPI document to generate Typescript
functions, and then use those to create Hasura metadata which defines our API.

In addition, once we've generated functions from our OpenAPI document, we can modify them or add new ones to
implement additional business logic.

## Step 1. Initialize the OpenAPI connector

:::tip Required

- [The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)

:::

To initialize the OpenAPI connector, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
ddn connector init my_openapi \
  --subgraph my_subgraph \
  --hub-connector hasura/openapi \
  --configure-port 8082 \
  --add-to-compose-file docker-compose.hasura.yaml
```

With this `connector init` command, we're passing a few important values.

**Connector name**

We're naming the connector `my_openapi` in this example, but you can call it whatever makes sense to you. For
example, if this connector is integrating an OpenAPI API regarding payments, it would make sense to name it
something like `payments_api`.

**Subgraph: `--subgraph`**

We're specifying the subgraph that this connector will be added to using the `--subgraph` flag.

**Connector: `--hub-connector`**

We're specifying that this connector should be the: `hasura/openapi`, connector listed in the
[Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors/openapi).

**Port: `configure-port`**

We're specifying the port to run the connector on. This is important to avoid port collisions with other connectors or
services which you might have running on your machine. Remember to use a different port for each connector or
service you may have running.

**Compose file: `--add-to-compose-file`**

We're specifying the `--add-to-compose-file` flag to add the connector's **own** Docker compose file to the main
`docker-compose.hasura.yaml` file. This is for convenience and allows us to start the Hasura Engine and connectors
together.

:::tip Best practices

Importantly, a data connector can only connect to one data source.

The project will be kept organized with each data connector's configuration located in a relevant subgraph directory. In
this example the CLI will create a `my_subgraph/connector/my_openapi` directory if it doesn't exist. You can also change
this directory by passing a `--dir` flag to the CLI.

The name of the connector and the directory in which the configuration is stored, `my_openapi` in this example, should
match for convenience and clarity sake.

In subsequent steps, when running your connector locally, it's critical to ensure the port value matches the connection
string you provide in your subgraph's `.env.my_subgraph` file.

:::

### What did this do?

In the `my_subgraph/connector/my_openapi` directory which we specified in the command, the CLI created:

- A `connector.local.yaml` file which contains the local configuration for the connector.
- A `connector.cloud.yaml` file which contains the cloud configuration for the connector.
- A `.hasura-connector/connector-metadata.yaml` file which contains extra metadata for the connector.
- A `docker-compose.my_openapi.yaml` a file to run the OpenAPI data connector locally in Docker. Includes the
specified port.
- A placeholder `.ddnignore` file to prevent unnecessary files from being included in the build.
- An `.env.local` placeholder file for environment variables for pertaining to running this connector locally.

Right now, the CLI has only scaffolded out configuration files for the data connector. Our connector still knows nothing
about the OpenAPI document. That's coming up in the next steps.

## Step 2. Add the OpenAPI connection URI or file

Now that our OpenAPI data connector has been scaffolded out for us, we need to provide it a **connection string** or
**swagger file** of the OpenAPI document for the service.

In the `.env.local` file which the CLI has provided for our connector, we can add the `NDC_OAS_DOCUMENT_URI` environment
variable which should point to the OpenAPI document. If you're using a file instead of a HTTP link, please ensure
that it is named `swagger.json` and is present in the root directory of the volume which is mounted to
`/etc/connector` (for this tutorial, the `swagger.json` file should be present at `my_subgraph/connector/my_openapi/`).

The `.env.local` file should look like this:

```text
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://local.hasura.dev:4317
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my_subgraph_my_openapi
NDC_OAS_DOCUMENT_URI=<your-openapi-document-uri>
```

:::tip Need a test OpenAPI document URI?

Feel free to use the pet store OpenAPI document available at:

```text
https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
```

:::

### Specifying the OpenAPI base URL

You can add the `NDC_OAS_BASE_URL` optional environment variable to the .env.local file. This should point to the
base URL of the API. Eg: `NDC_OAS_BASE_URL=https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3` This will be used as a string
literal in the `functions.ts` file which we'll generate in the next step to make API calls.

Alternatively, you can edit this value directly at the top of the `functions.ts` file manually later. Eg:
```typescript
const api = new Api({
  baseUrl: "https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3",
});
```

### Additional environment variables

The OpenAPI connector can also be configured with the following **extra optional environment variables**:

- `NDC_OAS_FILE_OVERWRITE` (optional): A Boolean flag to allow previously generated files to be over-written.
Defaults to `false`.
- `HASURA_PLUGIN_LOG_LEVEL` (optional): The log level. Possible values: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`,
`fatal`, `panic`. Defaults to `info`
- `NDC_OAS_LAMBDA_PRETTY_LOGS` (optional): A Boolean flag to print human readable logs instead of JSON. Defaults to
`false`

These environment variables are already referenced in the scaffolded out
`my_subgraph/connector/my_openapi/.hasura-connector/connector-metadata.yaml` file.

## Step 3. Introspect your OpenAPI document

This will introspect your OpenAPI document and files required to run the Typescript project.


```bash
ddn connector introspect --connector my_subgraph/connector/my_openapi/connector.local.yaml
```

### What did this do?

We specify the connector that we want to introspect with the `--connector` flag and provide it with the location of
that `connector.local.yaml` configuration file.

The CLI will introspect the OpenAPI document and create an `api.ts` file, a `functions.ts` file and other supporting
files in the `my_subgraph/connector/my_openapi` directory.

- The `api.ts` file contains the Data Types and API calls from the OpenAPI document.
- The `functions.ts` file contains functions that wrap API calls. You can modify this `functions.ts` file to introduce
extra business logic.

Yes! Connectors ship with OTEL-enabled tracing available, out of the box ðŸŽ‰

## Next steps

With these TypeScript files, which represent the endpoints in the OpenAPI document, we can now use it to
[generate Hasura metadata](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/02-create-source-metadata.mdx).
