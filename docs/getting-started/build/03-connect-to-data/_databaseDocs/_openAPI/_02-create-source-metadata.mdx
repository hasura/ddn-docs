## What's about to happen

Now that we have a TypeScript files of `api.ts` and `functions.ts`, which represent the OpenAPI spec, we can now use
them to generate Hasura metadata.

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/ERD/create-metadata.png" alt="Create source metadata" width="1000px" />

## Step 1. Create the Hasura metadata

:::tip Required

- [The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- An [OpenAPI connector](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx) initialized

:::

Hasura DDN uses a concept called "connector linking" to take configuration files from a data connector and transform
them into an [NDC-compliant](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec) `hml` (Hasura Metadata Language) file as a
[DataConnectorLink](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links/) metadata object.

Let's name the `DataConnectorLink` `hml` file the same as our connector, `my_openapi`:

```bash title="Run the following from the root of your project:"
ddn connector-link add my_openapi \
  --subgraph my_subgraph/subgraph.yaml \
  --configure-host http://local.hasura.dev:8086 \
  --target-env-file my_subgraph/.env.my_subgraph.local
```

The new file is scaffolded out at `my_subgraph/metadata/my_openapi/my_openapi.hml`.

:::info Typescript and HML, why both?

Metadata objects in `hml` files contain the data connector schema in a [format](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec)
which is generic for all connectors.

The TypeScript files on the other hand contain a format specific to the OpenAPI connector.

This format just needs to be a representation that each specific connector understands and can be different for other
connectors.

The process for this is:

1.  First generate the data source schema representation using the `ddn connector introspect` command
2.  Then use that to create the `DataConnectorLink` `hml` object with the `ddn connector-link add` and `update`
    commands.
3.  Finally, use the `ddn command add` and `ddn model add` commands to create the command and model objects which define
    our API.

  <summary>Click here for an example `hml` `DataConnectorLink` file</summary>

```yaml
kind: DataConnectorLink
version: v1
definition:
  name: my_openapi
  url:
    readWriteUrls:
      read:
        valueFromEnv: MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_OPENAPI_READ_URL
      write:
        valueFromEnv: MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_OPENAPI_WRITE_URL
  schema:
    version: v0.1
    schema:
      scalar_types: {}
      object_types: {}
      collections: []
      functions: []
      procedures: []
    capabilities:
      version: ""
      capabilities:
        query:
          nested_fields: {}
        mutation: {}
```

</details>

The generated file has two environment variables â€” one for reads and one for writes. Because we used the convenience
flag: `--configure-host` on the command, these values are already set in the `.env.my_subgraph` file:

```env title="Already set for you in .env.my_subgraph"
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_OPENAPI_READ_URL="http://local.hasura.dev:8086"
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_OPENAPI_WRITE_URL="http://local.hasura.dev:8086"
```

These values are for the OpenAPI connector itself and utilize `local.hasura.dev` to ensure proper resolution within the
docker container.

## Step 2. Update the new DataConnectorLink object with metadata for your OpenAPI service

Finally, now that our `DataConnectorLink` has the correct environment variables configured for the OpenAPI connector, we
can run the `update` command to have the CLI look at our `functions.ts` file and generate our `DataConnectorLink`
metadata in `hml` format:

```bash
ddn connector-link update my_openapi \
  --subgraph my_subgraph/subgraph.yaml \
  --env-file my_subgraph/.env.my_subgraph.local
```

After this command runs, you can open the same `my_subgraph/metadata/my_openapi/my_openapi.hml` file and see your
metadata completely scaffolded out for you ðŸŽ‰

## What did this do?

By creating a `my_openapi.hml` file, we've provided Hasura with a link between our original data source and the types
which we'll eventually expose via our API.

## Next steps

With a data connector fully configured, you can now start to create metadata for each endpoint in our OpenAPI document
in `hml`. Learn how to do this by
[adding source entities](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/03-add-source-entities.mdx).
