## What's about to happen?

We want to connect our [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) instance to our API. To do this, we use the Hasura
ClickHouse data connector to facilitate the connection and then introspect the database to generate JSON which the
Hasura CLI will then use to create metadata which can then define your API.

## Step 1. Init the ClickHouse connector

:::tip Required

- [The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)

:::

To initialize the ClickHouse connector, run the following command in your terminal.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn connector init my_clickhouse \
  --hub-connector hasura/clickhouse \
  --configure-port 8084 \
  --add-to-compose-file compose.yaml
```

With this `connector init` command, we're passing a few important values.

**Connector name**

We're naming the connector `my_clickhouse` in this example, but you can call it whatever makes sense to you. For
example, if this connector is integrating a database all about tracking courier delivery events, it would make sense to
name it something like `courier_events_clickhouse_connector`.

**Subgraph: `--subgraph`**

We're specifying the subgraph config file that this connector will be added to using the `--subgraph` flag.

**Connector: --hub-connector**

We're specifying that this connector should be the `hasura/clickhouse` connector listed in the
[Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors/clickhouse).

**Port: `configure-port`**

We're specifying the port to run the connector on. This is important to avoid port collisions with other connectors or
services which you might have running on your machine. Remember to use a different port for each connector you may have
running.

**Compose file: `--add-to-compose-file`**

We're specifying the `--add-to-compose-file` flag to add the connector's **own** Docker compose file to the main
`compose.yaml` file. This is for convenience and allows us to start the Hasura Engine and connectors together.

:::tip Best practices

Importantly, a data connector can only connect to one data source.

The project will be kept organized with each data connector's configuration located in a relevant subgraph directory. In
this example the CLI will create a `my_subgraph/connector/my_clickhouse` directory if it doesn't exist. You can also
change this directory by passing a `--dir` flag to the CLI.

We recommend that the name of the connector and the directory in which the configuration is stored, `my_clickhouse` in
this example, should match for convenience and clarity sake.

In subsequent steps, when running your connector locally, it's critical to ensure the port value matches the connection
string you provide in your subgraph's `.env.my_subgraph.local` file.

:::

### What did this do?

In the `my_subgraph/connector/my_clickhouse` directory which we specified in the command, the CLI created:

- A `connector.local.yaml` file which contains the local configuration for the connector.
- A `connector.cloud.yaml` file which contains the cloud configuration for the connector.
- A `.hasura-connector` folder which contains the connector definition used to build and run it.
- A `compose.yaml` a file to run the ClickHouse data connector locally in Docker.
- A placeholder `.ddnignore` file to prevent unnecessary files from being included in the build.
- An `.env.local` file for environment variables for pertaining to running this connector locally.
- An `.env.cloud` file for environment variables for pertaining to running this connector in the cloud.

Right now, the CLI has only scaffolded out configuration files for the data connector. Our connector still knows nothing
about the ClickHouse database or the data it contains. That's coming up in the next steps.

## Step 2. Add the required environment variables

Now that our connector has been scaffolded out for us, we need to provide a connection string, username, and password so
that the data source can be introspected and the boilerplate configuration can be taken care of by the CLI. Below, note
that there are a few caveats to consider before continuing.

The CLI has provided an `.env.local` file for our connector in the `my_subgraph/connector/my_clickhouse` directory. We
can add a key-value pair of `CONNECTION_URI` along with the connection string itself to this file and our connector will
use this to connect to our ClickHouse database. Then, add your username and password.

The file, after adding the `CONNECTION_URI` should look like this example:

```env title="my_subgraph/connector/my_clickhouse/.env.local"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://local.hasura.dev:4317
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my_subgraph_my_clickhouse
#highlight-start
CLICKHOUSE_URL=<clickhouse-connection-uri>
CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME=<your-username>
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=<your-password>
#highlight-end
```

You can use a local ClickHouse database or a cloud-hosted option. If you already have one you can connect to, you can go
ahead and do that using the steps above. Hasura DDN will not modify your database in any way, so you can use an existing
database without any worries.

:::tip Docker networking Inside a Docker container

`local.hasura.dev` is set to the `host-gateway` alias in the `extra_hosts` option. With this option set,
`local.hasura.dev` resolves to the host machine's gateway IP address from _inside_ the container. This allows various
containers, such as the GraphQL Engine and data connectors, to communicate with each other and out the host machine.

:::

:::info Environment-specific caveats

**Local ClickHouse**

If you're using a local ClickHouse database — such as through
[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/clickhouse/clickhouse-server/) — you can connect to it directly from the data
connector. However, if you deploy your connector to Hasura DDN, the cloud-hosted version of your data connector won't be
able to find your database. You'll need to use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel your database's
connection. This will expose the port, most likely `9000`, on which the database is running and allow Hasura DDN to
connect to it.

**Cloud-hosted ClickHouse**

Alternatively, if you have a cloud-hosted database, as Hasura DDN will need to reach your database, ensure you've
allowed connections from anywhere (for now) so that DDN is able to reach it.

:::

## Step 3. Introspect your database

With the connector configured, we can now use the CLI to introspect our ClickHouse database and create a source-specific
configuration file for our connector.

```bash title="From the root of your project run:"
ddn connector introspect --connector my_subgraph/connector/my_clickhouse/connector.local.yaml
```

## Step 4. Restart the services

Let's restart our docker compose services so that Docker can create a ClickHouse connector build for us now that we've
added and introspected the connector. **If you have existing services running, bring them down using
`docker compose down` or `CTRL` + `C` if your terminal tab is still actively logging information.**

```bash title="Run:"
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat) docker compose up --build --watch
```

This starts our Hasura Engine, observability tools and the PostgreSQL connector all together since we added the
connector's Docker compose file to the main `compose.yaml` file using the `--add-to-compose-file` flag when we
initialized the connector. `HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat)` gives the Hasura Engine access to the DDN CLI's
authentication token.

We can navigate to the following address, with the port modified, to see the schema of our ClickHouse database:

```text
http://localhost:8084/schema
```

## What did this do?

The commands above introspected your data source to create a JSON configuration file. If you look at the
`configuration.json` for your connector, you'll see metadata describing your ClickHouse schema.

:::tip Initialize a Git repository

At this point, we recommend initializing a Git repository. This gives you a fallback point as you begin to iterate on
your project.

:::

## Next steps

With this JSON configuration, which represents the tables in ClickHouse, we can now use it to
[generate Hasura metadata](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/02-create-source-metadata.mdx).
