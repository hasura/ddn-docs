# Update Data Source Metadata

## What's about to happen?

In your day-to-day development cycle, there's a good chance your data source's schema will change. When this happens,
you'll need to update your data connector configuration and the supergraph metadata to match these schema changes.

## Step 1. Introspect the data source

:::tip Required

- [The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- A [connector](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx) initialized.

:::

We can run the `connector introspect` command to have the CLI introspect the data source schema, update the
configuration of the connector and also update the corresponding `DataConnectorLink` metadata object for the supergraph
to be able to interact with the connector.

```bash title="Run the following command, updating the referenced name to match your connector:"
ddn connector introspect my_connector
```

After this command runs, you can open your `my_subgraph/metadata/my_connector.hml` file and see the `DataConnectorLink`
schema completely updated for you to match your data source's schema changes ðŸŽ‰.

## Step 2. Update or add models

If an existing model's schema changed in your data source, update it to ensure your Hasura metadata matches the data
source's schema.

```bash
ddn model update <model-name>
```

:::info Have lots of models?

If you have a large number of models and want to update them en masse, we've got you covered.

```bash title="Run the following:"
ddn model update "*"
```

You'll see the CLI output information about which models are the same, and which have changed.

:::

Alternatively, if you have models which need to be added (e.g., a new table in your underlying data source), you'll need
to create `hml` files for these resources.

```bash title="Run the following:"
ddn model add <connector-link-name> <collection-name>
```

:::info Have lots of new models to add?

If you have a large number of models, commands or relationships and want to add them en masse, we've got you covered
just as before.

```bash title="Run the following:"
ddn model add <connector-link-name> '*'
ddn command add <connector-link-name> '*'
ddn relationship add <connector-link-name> '*'
```

You'll see the CLI output information about which models are the same, and which have changed.

:::

## What did this do?

By updating the `my_connector.hml` file, we've provided Hasura with a link between our original data source and the
types which we'll eventually expose via our API.

```bash title="Be sure to create a new build before testing your API:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

## Next steps

With our data source connected and all of our models tracked, we can move on to
[add custom authorization rules](/getting-started/build/05-add-permissions.mdx) using permissions,
[incorporate custom business logic](/getting-started/build/06-add-business-logic.mdx), or
[create relationships](/getting-started/build/07-create-a-relationship.mdx) across data sources!
