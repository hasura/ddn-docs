# Connect to Data

You can connect any kind of data to Hasura DDN.

The connection is done through a [**data connector**](/connectors/overview.mdx), a piece of software independent of the
Hasura Engine which facilitates the connection.

You can use a data connector "off-the-shelf" and built by Hasura, one built by the community, or you can build your own.

Data connectors can be used directly via the [Hasura Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors/#connectors-list) using
the CLI. The Connector Hub is a managed list of connectors that you can use to connect to your data sources.

A data connector encapsulates a data source via a web service by implementing the protocol in the
[NDC specification](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/index.html).

You can connect cloud or local **data sources** via data connectors to Hasura DDN.

You can use the CLI to [add a data connector](/getting-started/build/connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx) for your
data source and generate the Hasura metadata.
