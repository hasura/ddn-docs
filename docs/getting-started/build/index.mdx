# Getting Started

## Introduction

Let's build a supergraph.

In this guide we'll walk through using Hasura DDN.

You're likely going to be introduced to new terminology, tools and concepts in the next few pages. Don't worry, they
will quickly become second nature to you.

:::info Local dev, verbose CLI, and using your own data

In this section we'll guide you through the process of building a supergraph API **locally** and thereafter, deploy it
to Hasura DDN cloud.

**We also recommend that you use your own data sources to effectively grok the concepts we're covering.** However, when
connecting a data source, we'll include some sample data source connection strings for you.

Get started by [installing the prerequisites](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx).
