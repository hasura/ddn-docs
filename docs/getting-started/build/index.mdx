# Getting Started

## Introduction

Let's build an API.

In this guide we'll walk through using Hasura DDN.

You're likely going to be introduced to new terminology, tools and concepts in the next few pages. Don't worry, they
will quickly become second nature to you.

:::info Local dev, verbose CLI, and using your own data

In this section we'll guide you through the process of building an API **locally** and thereafter, deploy it to
Hasura DDN cloud.

You'll also notice the frequent use of verbose, explicit CLI commands throughout this section. This is by design. The
DDN CLI is crafted to perform tasks atomically, enabling you to achieve specific outcomes efficiently while enabling
further convenience and automation in later versions, and for users to add it for themselves.

**We also recommend that you use your own data sources to effectively grok the concepts we're covering.** However, when
connecting a data source, we'll include some sample data source connection strings for you.
