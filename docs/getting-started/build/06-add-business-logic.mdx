# Add Custom Business Logic

## What's about to happen?

With Hasura, you can integrate — and even host — this business logic directly with Hasura DDN and your API.

You can handle custom business logic using the Node.js Lambda data connector. Using this connector, you can transform or
enrich data before it reaches your consumers, or perform any other app business logic you may need.

You can then integrate these functions as individual [**commands**](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) in your metadata
and resulting API. This process enables you to simplify client applications and speed up your backend development.

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- At least one [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version `>=20.0.0`

:::

In this guide we will:

- Initialize the `hasura/nodejs` data connector
- Use Node.js and npm to create a simple script
- Add a new `DataConnectorLink`
- Update the `DataConnectorLink` to track the function script as a command in our metadata
- Create a new API build and test it

### Step 1. Initialize the Node.js Lambda connector

Let's begin by initializing the connector on our project. In the example below, you'll see some familiar flags with new
values being passed to them. We'll call this the `ts_connector` and use the `hasura/nodejs` connector from the connector
hub:

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn connector init my_ts \
  --subgraph my_subgraph/subgraph.yaml \
  --hub-connector hasura/nodejs \
  --configure-port 8085
```

In this command, we're passing a few important values.

**Connector name**

We're naming the connector `my_ts` in this example, but you can call it whatever makes sense to you.

**Connector: `--hub-connector`**

We're specifying that this connector should be the: `hasura/nodejs`, connector listed in the
[Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors/nodejs-lambda).

**Port: `configure-port`**

We're specifying the port to run the connector on. This is important to avoid port collisions with other connectors or
services which you might have running on your machine. Remember to use a different port for each connector you may have
running.

:::tip Best practices

Importantly, a data connector can only connect to one data source.

The project will be kept organized with each data connector's configuration located in a relevant subgraph directory. In
this example the CLI will create a `my_subgraph/connector/my_ts` directory if it doesn't exist. You can also change this
directory by passing a `--dir` flag to the CLI.

We recommend that the name of the connector and the directory in which the configuration is stored, `my_ts` in this
example, should match for convenience and clarity sake.

In subsequent steps, when running your connector locally, it's critical to ensure the port value matches the connection
string you provide in your subgraph's `.env.my_subgraph` file.

:::

#### What did this do?

This command created the following file structure in a `my_subgraph/connector/my_ts` directory, with the `functions.ts`
file being your connector's entrypoint:

```bash
.
├── .ddnignore
├── .env.cloud
├── .env.local
├── .gitignore
├── .hasura-connector
│  ├── ...
├── compose.yaml
├── connector.cloud.yaml
├── connector.local.yaml
# highlight-start
├── functions.ts
# highlight-end
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### Step 2. Add the DataConnectorLink

As with any other connector, we'll now need to create the `DataConnectorLink` which will translate our TypeScript
functions into `hml` commands that can be exposed as queries and mutations via our GraphQL API. Create this using:

```bash title="Run the following from the root of your project:"
ddn connector-link add my_ts \
  --subgraph my_subgraph/subgraph.yaml \
  --configure-host http://local.hasura.dev:8085 \
  --target-env-file my_subgraph/.env.my_subgraph.local
```

The `--configure-host` convenience flag added the read and write URL for the connection to the `.env.my_subgraph` file
for us.

```env title="Example .env.my_subgraph file"
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_TS_READ_URL="http://local.hasura.dev:8085"
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_TS_WRITE_URL="http://local.hasura.dev:8085"
```

These keys are already referenced in `my_subgraph/metadata/my_ts/my_ts.hml`.

### Step 3. Install npm package dependencies

Let's install any necessary dependencies:

```bash title="Change to the connector directory and install dependencies:"
cd my_subgraph/connector/my_ts && npm i
```

Then, from the `my_ts` directory run this command to use the included `dotenv` package to load environment variables
from the `. env.local` file, start the connector, and watch for any changes:

```bash
npx dotenv -e .env.local -- npm run watch
```

:::warning Node.js version

The `hasura/nodejs` connector requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version `>=20.0.0`. Please make sure you have
the correct version installed.

:::

### Step 4. Write business logic

In this simple example, we're going to transform a timestamp with timezone (eg: "2024-03-14T08:00:00Z") into a nicely
formatted version for humans, eg: "8am, Thursday, March 14th, 2024."

We'll replace the default `hello()` function in our `functions.ts` file with the following:

```ts
/**
 * @readonly
 */
export async function formatTimezoneDate(dateString: string): Promise<string> {
  const date = new Date(dateString);

  const day = date.getDate();
  const nth = (d: number) => {
    if (d > 3 && d < 21) return "th";
    switch (d % 10) {
      case 1:
        return "st";
      case 2:
        return "nd";
      case 3:
        return "rd";
      default:
        return "th";
    }
  };

  const hours = date.getHours();
  const ampm = hours >= 12 ? "pm" : "am";
  const hour = hours % 12 || 12;

  const dayOfWeek = date.toLocaleString("en-US", { weekday: "long" });
  const month = date.toLocaleString("en-US", { month: "long" });
  const year = date.getFullYear();

  return `${hour}${ampm}, ${dayOfWeek}, ${month} ${day}${nth(day)}, ${year}.`;
}
```

As this is a Node.js project, you can install any dependency!

### Step 5. Track the new function

To add our function, similar to how we added our individual tables earlier, we can use the following to generate the
related Hasura metadata:

```bash
ddn connector-link update my_ts \
  --subgraph my_subgraph/subgraph.yaml \
  --env-file my_subgraph/.env.my_subgraph.local \
  --add-all-resources
```

### Step 6. Create a new API build and test

Next, let's create a new build of our supergraph:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local \
  --output-dir engine \
  --subgraph-env-file my_subgraph:my_subgraph/.env.my_subgraph.local
```

:::tip Start your engines!

Want to test your supergraph? Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine using the following command.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat) docker compose up --build --watch
```

This starts our Hasura Engine and observability tools. `HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat)` gives the Hasura Engine
access to the DDN CLI's authentication token.

:::

You should see your command available, along with its documentation, in the GraphiQL explorer which you should be able
to access at
[`https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql?url=http://localhost:3000`](https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql?url=http://localhost:3000).

```graphql title=" You can then test your new command with the following query:"
query MyQuery {
  mySubgraph_formatTimezoneDate(dateString: "2024-03-14T08:00:00Z")
}
```

:::tip Privacy settings in some browsers

Your browser settings or privacy tools may prevent the Console from accessing your local Hasura instance. This could be
due to features designed to protect your privacy and security. Should you encounter one of these issues, we recommend
disabling these settings for the `console.hasura.io` domain.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) are the recommended
browsers for the best experience with the Hasura Console including for local development.

:::

:::note Running Node.js in Docker

As you can see we're running Node.js and your functions directly on your own machine. You can also run your functions in
a Docker container along with your other Hasura services. The `connector init` command created a `Dockerfile` and a
`compose.yaml` file for you, so all you would need to do would be to:

- Make sure your port in your connector's `.env.local` and the one referenced in the
  `my_subgraph/connector/my_ts/compose.yaml` file `ports:published` field match and don't conflict with any other
  services you may need to run.
- Add the Node.js Lambda connector compose file to the main compose file in the root of the project if you want them to
  start all together. Eg:

```yaml title="At the top of the root compose.yaml"
include:
  - path: my_subgraph/connector/my_ts/compose.yaml
```

:::

## What did this do?

The commands above initialized a new Node.js Lambda connector, installed dependencies, and created a new function to
format a timestamp with timezone into a human-readable format. We then added this function to our metadata as a command,
and created a new build of our supergraph.

## Next Steps

You can also [create relationships](/getting-started/build/07-create-a-relationship.mdx) between types in your
supergraph and your commands. This enables you to pair custom business logic with — for example — database tables, and
then transform or enrich data before sending it back to your consumers.

You can learn more about creating these and other relationships on the
[next page](/getting-started/build/07-create-a-relationship.mdx), or you can learn about
[mutating data](/getting-started/build/08-mutate-data.mdx) using the TypeScript connector.
