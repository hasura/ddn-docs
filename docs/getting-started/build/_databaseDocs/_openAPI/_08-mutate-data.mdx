## What's about to happen?

We can add business logic to our existing or new functions to modify data before it's sent to the API, or before it's
returned to the client.

## Steps

## Step 1. Create or modify an existing function

:::tip Required

- [The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- A [OpenAPI connector](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx) initialized
- A [DataConnectorLink](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/02-create-source-metadata.mdx) configured

:::

For this example we'll add a step to an **existing function** to capitalize the name of a pet before it's added to the
store.

```ts title="my_subgraph/connector/my_openapi/functions.ts"
/**
 * Add a new pet to the store
 * @request POST :/pet
 * @allowrelaxedtypes
 * @save
 */
export async function postPetAddPet(
  /** Request body */
  data: Pet,
  headers?: hasuraSdk.JSONValue
): Promise<Pet> {
  // highlight-start
  // Capitalize pet's name
  data.name = data.name?.toUpperCase();
  // highlight-end

  const result = await api.pet.addPet({
    data: data,
    params: {
      headers: (headers?.value as Record<string, string>) ?? undefined,
    },
  });
  if (result.data) {
    return result.data;
  } else {
    throw result.error;
  }
}
```

We can also, for example, add a completely **new function** to get a pet by its ID and return a capitalized name:

```ts title="my_subgraph/connector/my_openapi/functions.ts"
/**
 * Find capitalized pet by ID
 * @request GET :/pet/{petId}
 * @allowrelaxedtypes
 * @readonly
 */
export async function getPetGetCapPetById(
  /**
   * ID of pet to return capitalized name
   */
  petId: number,
  headers?: hasuraSdk.JSONValue
): Promise<Pet> {
  const result = await api.pet.getPetById({
    petId: petId,
    params: {
      headers: (headers?.value as Record<string, string>) ?? undefined,
    },
  });
  if (result.data) {
    // highlight-start
    result.data.name = result.data.name?.toUpperCase();
    // highlight-end
    return result.data;
  } else {
    throw result.error;
  }
}
```

If we use the "@save" tag in the JSDoc comments for the function, changes we make to the function will not be
overwritten if we re-introspect the connector.

:::info JSDoc comments

The OpenAPI connector uses [JSDoc comments](https://jsdoc.app/) to determine how to expose a function: either as a query
or a mutation. If we include the `@readOnly` tag, it will be exposed as a query. Simply omitting this tag will expose
the function as a mutation.

We can even add documentation that will be visible in the GraphiQL explorer by tagging `@param` for the argument(s) and
`@returns` for what will be returned by the mutation.

`@allowrelaxedtypes` converts unsupported types into scalars. This is because certain TypeScript types, such as `any`
don't map well to GraphQL. So, `@allowrelaxedtypes` tells the connector to convert these into an opaque scalar type
instead of rejecting the function that uses them.

:::

## Step 2. Track the function

We'll track our function using the CLI by first updating our `DataConnectorLink` for this data connector:

```bash
ddn connector-link update <connector-name>
```

And then bringing in the command:

```bash
ddn command add <connector-name> getPetGetCapPetById
```

## Step 3. Create a new build and test

Next, let's create a new build of our supergraph:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
```

:::tip Start your engines!

Want to test your supergraph? Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine and connectors using the following command.

```bash title="Run the following command, updating the referenced paths to match your directory structure:"
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat) docker compose --env-file .env up --build --watch
```

**If you haven't [included your connector(s)](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx) in your
`docker-compose.hasura.yaml`, don't forget to start it as well.**

:::

Finally, should see your command available in the GraphiQL explorer. Head to
[`https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql?url=http://localhost:3000`](https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql?url=http://localhost:3000)
and interact with your API using the Hasura Console.

If you want a quick way of opening the console, you can run the following command:

```bash title="Run:"
ddn console -l
```
