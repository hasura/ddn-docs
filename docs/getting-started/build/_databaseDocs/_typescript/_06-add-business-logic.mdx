## What's about to happen?

With Hasura, you can integrate — and even host — this business logic directly with Hasura DDN and your API.

You can handle custom business logic using the Node.js Lambda data connector. Using this connector, you can transform or
enrich data before it reaches your consumers, or perform any other app business logic you may need.

You can then integrate these functions as individual [**commands**](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) in your metadata
and resulting API. This process enables you to simplify client applications and speed up your backend development.

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- At least one [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version `>=20.0.0`

:::

In this guide we will:

- Initialize the `hasura/nodejs` data connector
- Use Node.js and npm to create a simple script
- Add a new `DataConnectorLink`
- Update the `DataConnectorLink` to track the function script as a command in our metadata
- Create a new API build and test it

### Step 1. Initialize the Node.js Lambda connector

Let's begin by initializing the connector on our project. In the example below, you'll see a familiar flow and use the
`hasura/nodejs` connector from the connector hub.

```bash title="Run the following command:"
ddn connector init -i
```

- Select `hasura/nodejs` from the list of connectors.
- Name it something descriptive. For this example, we'll call it `my_ts`.
- Choose a port (press enter to accept the default recommended by the CLI).

:::tip Best practices

Importantly, a data connector can only connect to one data source.

In subsequent steps, when running your connector locally, it's critical to ensure the port value matches the connection
string you provide in the key-value pair for your `.env` file.

:::

#### What did this do?

This command created the following file structure in a `my_subgraph/connector/my_ts` directory, with the `functions.ts`
file being your connector's entrypoint:

```bash
.
├── .ddnignore
├── .hasura-connector
│  ├── ...
├── compose.yaml
├── connector.yaml
#highlight-start
├── functions.ts
#highlight-end
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### Step 2. Install npm package dependencies

Let's install any necessary dependencies:

```bash title="Change to the connector directory and install dependencies:"
cd my_subgraph/connector/my_ts && npm i
```

### Step 3. Run the connector

Then, from the `my_ts` directory run this command to load environment variables
from your project's `.env` file, start the connector, and watch for any changes:

```bash
ddn connector setenv --connector connector.yaml -- npm run start
```

:::warning Node.js version

The `hasura/nodejs` connector requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version `>=20.0.0`. Please make sure you have
the correct version installed.

:::

### Step 4. Write business logic

In this simple example, we're going to transform a timestamp with timezone (eg: "2024-03-14T08:00:00Z") into a nicely
formatted version for humans, eg: "8am, Thursday, March 14th, 2024."

We'll replace the default `hello()` function in our `functions.ts` file with the following:

```ts
/**
 * @readonly
 */
export async function formatTimezoneDate(dateString: string): Promise<string> {
  const date = new Date(dateString);

  const day = date.getDate();
  const nth = (d: number) => {
    if (d > 3 && d < 21) return "th";
    switch (d % 10) {
      case 1:
        return "st";
      case 2:
        return "nd";
      case 3:
        return "rd";
      default:
        return "th";
    }
  };

  const hours = date.getHours();
  const ampm = hours >= 12 ? "pm" : "am";
  const hour = hours % 12 || 12;

  const dayOfWeek = date.toLocaleString("en-US", { weekday: "long" });
  const month = date.toLocaleString("en-US", { month: "long" });
  const year = date.getFullYear();

  return `${hour}${ampm}, ${dayOfWeek}, ${month} ${day}${nth(day)}, ${year}.`;
}
```

As this is a Node.js project, you can install any dependency!

### Step 5. Track the new function

To add our function, we can use the following to generate the related metadata that will link together any functions
in this `functions.ts` file and our API.

```bash
ddn connector introspect my_ts
```

Then, we can generate an `hml` file for the function using the following command.

```bash title="Track the function:"
ddn command add my_ts formatTimezoneDate
```

:::info Have a lot of functions?

If you have a lot of functions and want to add them all en masse, you can use the CLI to generate metadata for each.

```bash title="Run the following:"
ddn connector-link add-resources my_ts
```

:::

#### What did this do?

The command introspected your `functions.ts` file and found any functions present along with their argument and return
types.

The CLI then used this to create Hasura metadata for each function which can then be exposed in your API.

### Step 6. Create a new API build and test

Next, let's create a new build of our supergraph:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
```

:::tip Start your engines!

Want to test your supergraph? Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine using the following command.

```bash title="Run:"
ddn run docker-start
```

This reads `docker-start` script from the context config at `.hasura/context.yaml` and starts our Hasura Engine and
observability tools.

:::

You should see your command available, along with its documentation, in the GraphiQL explorer which you should be able
to access using the CLI.

```bash title="Run:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title=" You can then test your new command with the following query:"
query MyQuery {
  formatTimezoneDate(dateString: "2024-03-14T08:00:00Z")
}
```

:::tip Privacy settings in some browsers

Your browser settings or privacy tools may prevent the Console from accessing your local Hasura instance. This could be
due to features designed to protect your privacy and security. Should you encounter one of these issues, we recommend
disabling these settings for the `console.hasura.io` domain.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) are the recommended
browsers for the best experience with the Hasura Console including for local development.

:::

:::note Running Node.js in Docker

As you can see we're running Node.js and your functions directly on your own machine. You can also run your functions in
a Docker container along with your other Hasura services. The `connector init` command created a `Dockerfile` and a
`compose.yaml` file for you, so all you would need to do would be to:

- Make sure your port in your connector's `.env` and the one referenced in the
  `my_subgraph/connector/my_ts/compose.yaml` file `ports:published` field match and don't conflict with any other
  services you may need to run.
- Add the Node.js Lambda connector compose file to the main compose file in the root of the project if you want them to
  start all together. Eg:

```yaml title="At the top of the root compose.yaml"
include:
  - path: my_subgraph/connector/my_ts/compose.yaml
```

:::

## What did this do?

The commands above initialized a new Node.js Lambda connector, installed dependencies, and created a new function to
format a timestamp with timezone into a human-readable format. We then added this function to our metadata as a command,
and created a new build of our supergraph.

## Next Steps

You can also [create relationships](/getting-started/build/07-create-a-relationship.mdx) between types in your
supergraph and your commands. This enables you to pair custom business logic with — for example — database tables, and
then transform or enrich data before sending it back to your consumers.

You can learn more about creating these and other relationships on the
[next page](/getting-started/build/07-create-a-relationship.mdx), or you can learn about
[mutating data](/getting-started/build/08-mutate-data.mdx) using the TypeScript connector.
