## What's about to happen?

With Hasura, you can integrate — and even host — business logic directly with Hasura DDN and your API.

You can handle custom business logic using the Python Lambda connector. Using this connector, you can transform or
enrich data before it reaches your consumers, or perform any other app business logic you may need.

You can then integrate these functions as individual [**commands**](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) in your metadata
and resulting API. This process simplifies client applications and speeds up your backend development.

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- At least one [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version `>=3.11`

:::

In this guide we will:

- Initialize the `hasura/python` data connector
- Use Python and pip to create a simple script
- Generate the metadata to track the function script as a command in our metadata
- Create a new API build and test it

### Step 1. Initialize the Python Lambda connector

Let's begin by initializing the connector on our project. In the example below, you'll see a familiar flow and use the
`hasura/python` connector from the connector hub.

```bash title="Run the following command:"
ddn connector init -i
```

- Select `hasura/python` from the list of connectors.
- Name it something descriptive. For this example, we'll call it `my_python`.
- Choose a port (press enter to accept the default recommended by the CLI).


#### What did this do?

This command created the following file structure in a `my_subgraph/connector/my_python` directory, with the
`functions.py` file being your connector's entrypoint:

```bash
.
├── .ddnignore
├── .gitignore
├── .hasura-connector
│  ├── ...
├── compose.yaml
├── connector.yaml
# highlight-start
├── functions.py
# highlight-end
└── requirements.txt
```

### Step 2. Write business logic

The template code that ships with the Python Lambda connector provides some simple examples to help explain how it
works. We can replace those example functions for now.

In this simple example, we're going to transform a timestamp with timezone (eg: "2024-03-14T08:00:00Z") into a nicely
formatted version for humans, eg: "8am, Thursday, March 14th, 2024."

We'll replace the all the default functions in our `functions.py` file with the following:

```python
from hasura_ndc import start
from hasura_ndc.function_connector import FunctionConnector
from datetime import datetime # Don't forget to import datetime at the top of the file!

connector = FunctionConnector()

@connector.register_query
async def format_timezone_data(date_string: str) -> str:
    date = datetime.fromisoformat(date_string)

    day = date.day
    nth = lambda d: "th" if 11 <= d <= 13 else {1: "st", 2: "nd", 3: "rd"}.get(d % 10, "th")

    hours = date.hour
    ampm = "pm" if hours >= 12 else "am"
    hour = hours % 12 or 12

    day_of_week = date.strftime("%A")
    month = date.strftime("%B")
    year = date.year

    return f"{hour}{ampm}, {day_of_week}, {month} {day}{nth(day)}, {year}."


if __name__ == "__main__":
    start(connector)
```

As this is a Python project, you can install any dependency!

### Step 3. Track the new function

To add our function, we can use the following to generate the related metadata that will link together any functions in
this `functions.py` file and our API.

```bash
ddn connector introspect my_python
```

Then, we can generate an `hml` file for the function using the following command.

```bash title="Track the function:"
ddn command add my_python formatTimezoneDate
```

:::info Have a lot of functions?

If you have a lot of functions and want to add them all en masse, you can use the CLI to generate metadata for each.

```bash title="Run the following:"
ddn command add my_python "*"
```

:::

#### What did this do?

The command introspected your `functions.ts` file and found any functions present along with their argument and return
types.

The CLI then used this to create Hasura metadata for each function which can then be exposed in your API.

### Step 4. Create a new API build and test

Next, let's create a new build of our supergraph:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
```

:::tip Start your engines!

Want to test your supergraph? Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine using the following command:

```bash title="Run:"
ddn run docker-start
```

This reads the `docker-start` script from the context config at `.hasura/context.yaml` and starts your Hasura engine,
any connectors, and observability tools.

:::

You should see your command available, along with its documentation, in the GraphiQL explorer which you should be able
to access using the CLI.

```bash title="Run:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title=" You can then test your new command with the following query:"
query MyQuery {
  formatTimezoneDate(dateString: "2024-03-14T08:00:00Z")
}
```

:::tip Privacy settings in some browsers

Your browser settings or privacy tools may prevent the Console from accessing your local Hasura instance. This could be
due to features designed to protect your privacy and security. Should you encounter one of these issues, we recommend
disabling these settings for the `console.hasura.io` domain.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) are the recommended
browsers for the best experience with the Hasura Console including for local development.

:::

:::note Running Python locally

By default, Python and your functions run in a Docker container along with your other Hasura services. The
`connector init` command created a `compose.yaml` file for you, which are used by default.

However, if you prefer to run Python directly on your local machine, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version `>=3.11` installed on your machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash title="Change to the connector directory and install dependencies:"
cd my_subgraph/connector/my_python && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. From the `my_python` directory, run this command to load environment variables from your project's `.env` file,
start the connector, and watch for any changes:

On Mac or Linux:
```bash
watchmedo auto-restart --patterns="*.py" --recursive -- sh -c "export \$(grep -v '^#' .env.local | xargs) && python3 functions.py serve"
```

On Windows:
```powershell
watchmedo auto-restart --patterns="*.py" --recursive -- powershell -Command "Get-Content .env.local | ForEach-Object { if ($_ -notmatch '^#') { $var = $_.Split('='); Set-Item \"env:$($var[0])\" $var[1] } }; python3 functions.py serve"
```

Make sure the port specified in your connector's `.env` file doesn't conflict with any other services you may be
running.

## What did this do?

The commands above initialized a new Python Lambda connector, installed dependencies, and created a new function to
format a timestamp with timezone into a human-readable format. We then added this function to our metadata as a command,
and created a new build of our supergraph.

## Next Steps

You can also [create relationships](/getting-started/build/07-create-a-relationship.mdx) between types in your
supergraph and your commands. This enables you to pair custom business logic with — for example — database tables, and
then transform or enrich data before sending it back to your consumers.

You can learn more about creating these and other relationships on the
[next page](/getting-started/build/07-create-a-relationship.mdx), or you can learn about
[mutating data](/getting-started/build/08-mutate-data.mdx) with examples using the TypeScript connector. Although the
examples for mutating data are provided in Typescript, you could just as easily use the Python connector.
