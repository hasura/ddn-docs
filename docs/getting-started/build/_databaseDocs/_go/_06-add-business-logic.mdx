## What's about to happen?

With Hasura, you can integrate — and even host — business logic directly with Hasura DDN and your API.

You can handle custom business logic using the Go connector. Using this connector, you can transform or
enrich data before it reaches your consumers, or perform any other app business logic you may need.

You can then integrate these functions as individual [**commands**](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) in your metadata
and resulting API. This process simplifies client applications and speeds up your backend development.

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- At least one [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- [Go](https://go.dev/) version `>=1.21.0`

:::

In this guide we will:

- Initialize the `hasura/go` data connector
- Generate the metadata to track the function script as a command in our metadata
- Create a new API build and test it

### Step 1. Initialize the Go connector

Let's begin by initializing the connector on our project. In the example below, you'll see a familiar flow and use the
`hasura/go` connector from the connector hub.

```bash title="Run the following command:"
ddn connector init my_go -i
```

- Select `hasura/go` from the list of connectors.
- Choose a port (press enter to accept the default recommended by the CLI).
- In this example, we've called the connector `my_go`. You can name it something descriptive.

:::tip Best practices

Importantly, a data connector can only connect to one data source.

The project will be kept organized with each data connector's configuration located in a relevant subgraph directory. In
this example the CLI will create a `my_subgraph/connector/my_go` directory if it doesn't exist. You can also change this
directory by passing a `--dir` flag to the CLI.

We recommend that the name of the connector and the directory in which the configuration is stored, `my_go` in this
example, should match for convenience and clarity sake.

:::

#### What did this do?

This command created the following file structure in a `my_subgraph/connector/my_go` directory, with Go files in the
`functions` folder being your connector's entrypoint:

```bash
.
├── .ddnignore
├── .gitignore
├── .hasura-connector
│  ├── ...
├── compose.yaml
# highlight-start
├── functions
│  ├── hello.go
│  ├── types.generated.go
# highlight-end
├── types
│  ├── connector.go
├── connector.generated.go
├── connector.go
├── main.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── schema.generated.json
```

### Step 2. Write business logic

The template code that ships with the Go connector provides some simple examples in the `functions/hello.go` file to
help explain how it works.

Functions that have a `Function` prefix are allowed to be exposed as a read-only queries. For example:

```go
// A hello argument
type HelloArguments struct {
  Greeting string `json:"greeting"` // value argument will be required
  Count    *int   `json:"count"`    // pointer arguments are optional
}

// A hello result
type HelloResult struct {
  Reply string `json:"reply"`
  Count int    `json:"count"`
}

// FunctionHello sends a hello message
func FunctionHello(ctx context.Context, state *types.State, arguments *HelloArguments) (*HelloResult, error) {
  count := 1
  if arguments.Count != nil {
    count = *arguments.Count + 1
  }
  return &HelloResult{
    Reply: fmt.Sprintf("Hi! %s", arguments.Greeting),
    Count: count,
  }, nil
}
```

Functions that have a `Procedure` prefix are allowed to be exposed as a mutation. For example:

```go
// A create author argument
type CreateAuthorArguments struct {
  Name string `json:"name"`
}

// A create author result
type CreateAuthorResult struct {
  ID   int    `json:"id"`
  Name string `json:"name"`
}

// ProcedureCreateAuthor creates an author
func ProcedureCreateAuthor(ctx context.Context, state *types.State, arguments *CreateAuthorArguments) (*CreateAuthorResult, error) {
  return &CreateAuthorResult{
    ID:   1,
    Name: arguments.Name,
  }, nil
}
```

The CLI plugin infers the third argument of the function and generates the input argument. The first result type is
generated as the response schema.

See more details in the documentation of
[hasura-ndc-go](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-go/tree/main/cmd/hasura-ndc-go) plugin.

### Step 3. Track the new function

To add our function, we can use the following to generate the related metadata that will link together any functions in
the `functions` folder and our API.

```bash
ddn connector introspect my_go
```

Then, we can generate an `hml` file for the function using the following command.

```bash title="Track the function:"
ddn command add my_go hello
```

:::info Have a lot of functions?

If you have a lot of functions and want to add them all en masse, you can use the CLI to generate metadata for each.

```bash title="Run the following:"
ddn command add my_go "*"
```

:::

#### What did this do?

The command introspected your `functions` directory and found any functions present along with their argument and return
types.

The CLI then used this to create Hasura metadata for each function which can then be exposed in your API.

### Step 4. Create a new API build and test

Next, let's create a new build of our supergraph:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
```

:::tip Start your engines!

Want to test your supergraph? Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine using the following command:

```bash title="Run:"
ddn run docker-start
```

This reads the `docker-start` script from the context config at `.hasura/context.yaml` and starts your Hasura engine,
any connectors, and observability tools.

:::

You should see your command available, along with its documentation, in the GraphiQL explorer which you should be able
to access using the CLI.

```bash title="Run:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title=" You can then test your new command with the following query:"
query Hello {
  hello(greeting: "world") {
    reply
    count
  }
}
```

:::tip Privacy settings in some browsers

Your browser settings or privacy tools may prevent the Console from accessing your local Hasura instance. This could be
due to features designed to protect your privacy and security. Should you encounter one of these issues, we recommend
disabling these settings for the `console.hasura.io` domain.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) are the recommended
browsers for the best experience with the Hasura Console including for local development.

:::

## What did this do?

The commands above initialized a new Go connector, installed dependencies, and created a new function and procedure to
demonstrate how the connector works. We then added this function to our metadata as a command, and created a new build
of our supergraph.

## Next Steps

You can also [create relationships](/getting-started/build/07-create-a-relationship.mdx) between types in your
supergraph and your commands. This enables you to pair custom business logic with — for example — database tables, and
then transform or enrich data before sending it back to your consumers.

You can learn more about creating these and other relationships on the
[next page](/getting-started/build/07-create-a-relationship.mdx).
