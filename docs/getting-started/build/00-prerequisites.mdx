# Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have the following pieces of software at the correct minimum versions installed on your
machine:

## Step 1. Install and authorize the Hasura CLI

<InstallTheCli />

### Step 1.1 Login with the CLI

```bash title="After installation, from any directory, run the following command to authenticate your CLI session with Hasura DDN."
ddn auth login
```

A new window will open either asking you to sign in or authenticating your current session and allow you to return to
the CLI.

## Step 2. Install the Hasura VS Code extension {#install-lsp}

If you don't already have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed, we recommend you
download and install it. Then, install the
[Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) so that you can make use
of features like autocomplete, contextual suggestions, and inline validation to enhance your development experience.

## Step 3. Install Docker Compose v2.27.1 or greater

Finally, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), which will be used for local development. This helps
you iterate and develop locally without deploying any changes to Hasura DDN, making the development experience faster
and your feedback loops shorter.

:::warning Docker version requirement

Docker Compose `v2.27.1` or greater is required to run local services. To check your version of Docker Compose, run:

```bash
docker compose version
```

[Click here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to download the latest version of Docker which includes Docker
Compose.

If you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your system you can upgrade
from inside the application.

:::

:::warning Console-compatible browsers

Your browser settings, privacy tools or browser extensions may prevent the console from accessing your local Hasura
instance. This could be due to features designed to protect your privacy and security. Should you encounter one of these
issues, we recommend disabling these settings for the `console.hasura.io` domain.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) are the recommended
browsers for the best experience with the Hasura console, including for local development.

## Next Steps

At this point, you're ready to [create your first supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)!

**Alternatively**, if you've been invited to an _existing_ supergraph repository, you might want to
[add a new subgraph](./02-init-subgraph.mdx), [connect a data source](./03-connect-to-data/index.mdx),
[create a relationship](./07-create-a-relationship.mdx), or [add some business logic](./06-add-business-logic.mdx).
