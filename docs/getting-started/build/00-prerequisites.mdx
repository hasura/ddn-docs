# Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you've completed the following things:

## Step 1. Install the Hasura CLI

<InstallTheCli />

```bash title="After installation, from any directory, run the following command to authenticate your CLI session with Hasura DDN."
ddn auth login
```

A new window will open either asking you to sign in or authenticating your current session and allow you to return to
the CLI.

## Step 2. Install the Hasura VS Code extension {#install-lsp}

If you don't already have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed, we recommend you
download and install it. Then, install the
[Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) so that you can make use
of features like autocomplete, contextual suggestions, and inline validation to enhance your development experience.

## Step 3. Install Docker

Finally, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), which will be used for local development. This helps
you iterate and develop locally without deploying any changes to Hasura DDN, making the development experience faster
and your feedback loops shorter.

:::info Docker version

Docker Compose `v2.22.0` or greater is required to run `watch` mode.

## Next Steps

At this point, you're ready to [create your first supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)!

Alternatively, if you've been invited to an existing supergraph repository, you might want to add a new subgraph,
connect a data source, create a relationship, or add some business logic.
