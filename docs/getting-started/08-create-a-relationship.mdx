# Create a Relationship to a Command

As it stands, our `humanReadableCreatedAt` command created in the previous step isn't super useful. It's preferable to
return this value when we're querying for a user's information. We can easily utilize this business logic in a request
from a client by creating a relationship.

For our example, let's take our `Users.hml` file and create a new relationship. Remember, we can use the LSP to help us
in authoring this:

```yaml
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: humanReadableCreatedAt
  source: Users
  target:
    command:
      name: HumanReadableCreatedAt
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: id
      target:
        argument:
          argumentName: userId
```

We can then update our `Users` model:

```bash
ddn model update Users
```

And create a new build before testing this:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

In our example, when querying a user's information, we can now return the transformed data as part of the simple query
from the client 🎉
