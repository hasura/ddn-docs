# Quickstart from VS Code

## Introduction

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create a new Hasura project, connect a database, execute your first
query, and create lightning-fast production builds â€” all using VS Code and the **new Hasura CLI**. Throughout this
guide, you'll be introduced to new Hasura concepts, like builds, our new metadata structure, and more.

:::tip Prerequisites

1. The [new Hasura CLI](/ci-cd/hasura-cli.mdx)
2. The [Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura)
3. A PostgreSQL database

If you're looking for a fast and easy way to get started with a PostgreSQL database, check out our friends at
[Neon](https://neon.tech).

## Step 1: Log into Hasura

To make a secure connection, you'll need a personal access token (PAT) from Hasura Cloud:

1. Head [here](https://cloud.hasura.io/account-settings/access-tokens) to generate your PAT.
2. Use the following command to add the token to the CLI, thereby logging you in:

```bash
hasura3 cloud login --pat <YOUR_PAT>
```

:::info New CLI?!

Yep! If you can't tell already, we've completely rewritten the CLI from the ground up. You can learn more about the new
commands by running:

```bash
hasura3 --help
```

:::

## Step 2: Create a new project

To create a new local project, use the following command, passing the directory where you want to create the metadata
file as an argument. This command will create a `metadata.hml` file by default:

```bash
hasura3 local init --dir <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
```

You can then create the corresponding project on Hasura using the following command:

```bash
hasura3 cloud project create
```

The CLI will return information about your project:

```text
 Creating project... ok
 Name         <PROJECT_NAME>
 ID           <PROJECT_ID>
 Console URL  https://console.hasura.io/project/<PROJECT_ID>/graphql
```

:::info What's a local project?

Each project on Hasura Cloud can have a corresponding local project that can be used for development. This local project
only contains the Hasura metadata file that follows the new metadata format of the
[Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD Spec)](/data-domain-modeling/overview.mdx), and is an `.hml` file. This file can
be checked into version control along with other files (if any) of your project and can be shared.

We've created a new flavor of yaml called `Hasura Markup Language` (`hml`) that allows you to accelerate your workflows
by using the Hasura VS Code extension.

:::

## Step 3: Connect a data source

Open your empty `metadata.hml` file and start typing `HasuraHubDataSource`. Hit `Enter` and the extension will
automatically populate the rest of the template for you:

```yaml
kind: HasuraHubDataSource
name:
connectorId:
connectorConfiguration:
  version:
  connection_uris:
```

| Field                    | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                   | The name of your data source. Put `default` for now.                                    |
| `connectorId`            | The ID of the connector you want to use. In this example, we'll use `hasura/postgres`.  |
| `connectorConfiguration` | The configuration for your connector, made up of `version` and `connection_uris`. |
| `version`                | The version of your connector. Put `1` for now.                                         |
| `connection_uris`        | The connection string for your database. Add your database's connection string.         |

## Step 4: Scaffold your metadata

In VS Code, press `Command + Shift + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows) to open the Command Palette. Type
`hasura refresh data source` and choose the option that appears.

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_vs-code-refresh-data-source.png" alt="Execute a query" width="1000px" />

You should now see the name you provided in the previous step. Clicking this will introspect your data source and add
information to your metadata about the tables and views in your database.

From here, you can immediately track tables, views, relationships, and quickly scaffold out your metadata by using the
Hasura VS Code extension. Bring up the command palette again, type `hasura track all` and choose the option from the
dropdown. Then, select your data source's name and, viola â€” your metadata file will be populated with **models** and
everything you need to get started! ðŸŽ‰

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_vs-code-track-everything.png" alt="Execute a query" width="1000px" />

:::info What are models?

This is the first new concept we've introduced in this guide. models are a new way to represent your data in Hasura.

Models in the [OpenDD Spec](/data-domain-modeling/overview.mdx) refer to a collection of objects (such as rows in a
relational database, or documents in a NoSQL database) of a given OpenDD Spec [type](/data-domain-modeling/types.mdx).
Models are backed by a data source and can support CRUD operations. You can learn more about models
[here](/data-domain-modeling/models.mdx).

:::

## Step 5: Create a new build

Create a build using the following command:

```bash
hasura3 cloud build create --project-id <PROJECT_ID> --metadata-file <METADATA_FILE>
```

The CLI will return:

- a build ID
- a build Version
- a GraphQL API Endpoint for this build

We'll use this information in the next step to test our API!

:::info What's a build?

Builds are a new concept in Hasura that allow you to quickly iterate and prototype on your project's metadata. A build
is an immutable, fully-functioning GraphQL API that represents a milestone in your development cycle.

It may be helpful to think of builds as git commits. Since each is deployed on Hasura Cloud, it can be shared with other
users.

Each build is completely independent. One project can have multiple builds, out of which, one is applied to production.
This workflow allows for easier rollbacks on production, and greater collaboration during development.

:::

## Step 6: Run your first query

Assuming you have some tables and data in your database, you can now run your first query! Head to the
[Console](https://console.hasura.io) URL returned by the CLI in the previous step. You'll be prompted to log in. Once
you're logged in, you'll be taken to the GraphiQL Explorer, where you can execute queries against your API.

We're using the docs sample app's schema for this guide's visuals, but you can use the GraphiQL Explorer to create your
query or write it manually:

## Step 7: Apply your build

To apply a build using the CLI, run the following command:

```bash
hasura3 cloud build apply --project-id <PROJECT_ID> --build-id <BUILD_ID>
```

:::tip Quickly find IDs for Projects and builds!

You can use the following command to list your projects:

```bash
hasura3 cloud project list
```

You can use the following command to list your builds:

```bash
hasura3 cloud build list --project-id <PROJECT_ID>
```

:::

:::info What does it mean to apply a build?

Applying a build means that it's being promoted to your project's production environment. **This is a new concept in
Hasura which allows you to quickly iterate â€” and, if needed, roll back â€” your project's metadata to all of your users,
worldwide.**

:::

## Step 8: Query your production endpoint

At the top of the Console, you'll see a toggle that allows you to switch between your project's API and your project's
currently selected preview build. Toggle to your project's applied build:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.1.1_console-view-project-graphiql.png" alt="Toggle production" width="1000px" />

You can now execute a query against this endpoint.

## What's next?

### Iterate on your metadata

We've just demonstrated how to quickly get set up and running with Hasura. Now that you've got a project up and running,
you can iterate on your metadata and build out your API. Head back to your IDE, make some modifications, create a new
build, and see what happens ðŸŽ‰
