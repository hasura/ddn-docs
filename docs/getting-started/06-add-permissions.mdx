# Add Authorization

## What's about to happen?

If you've already created and tested your supergraph, you'll have seen that queries are executed by default using the
`admin` role. However, you can easily add authorization rules — what we term permissions — by simply using the same
declarative metadata approach we've seen for relationships and versioning.

In the steps below, we'll add
[`modelPermissions`](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#modelpermissions-modelpermissions) to control which types can
be accessed by a user role and [`typePermissions`](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#typepermissions-typepermissions)
to control what fields are returned by your API.

:::tip You can use LSP!

You can use the VS Code extension, powered by LSP, to help you author any metadata objects or updates, including
`modelPermissions` and `typePermissions`. You can activate it's autocomplete abilities using `CTRL+SPACEBAR` inside of
any `hml` file.

## Steps

### Step 1. Create a modelPermission

By default, a role of `admin` exists for your API and can access all models. To create a new role, such as `user`,
simply add the role to the list of `permissions` for a model and set up your access control rules. In the example below,
we'll allow users with the role of `user` to access only their own rows from a `Users` model by checking for a header
value matching their `id`:

```yaml
# Users.hml
---
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Users
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
        #highlight-start
    - role: user
      select:
        filter:
          fieldComparison:
            field: id
            operator: _eq
            value:
              sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
        #highlight-end
```

:::tip Where are models?

Remember, models are organized under a `models` subdirectory under the connector's named directory in a subgraph.

### Step 2. Create a typePermission

The `admin` role also has access to all fields for each model. However, adding a new role and limiting what columns can
be returned from your data source is just as simple. For example, let's restrict what a `user` can see by omitting
several fields from the `typePermissions`:

```yaml
---
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: Users
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - createdAt
          - email
          - favoriteArtist
          - id
          - isEmailVerified
          - lastSeen
          - name
          - password
          - updatedAt
    #highlight-start
    - role: user
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - email
          - favoriteArtist
          - id
          - name
          - password
    #highlight-end
```

### Step 3. Create a new build

As we've altered our metadata, create a new build to test it:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

:::tip Start your engines!

Want to test your supergraph? Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine and connectors using the following command:

```bash
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn internal print-pat) docker compose -f docker-compose.hasura.yaml watch
```

:::

Creating a new build after modifying this metadata will allow us to use two headers in our request: `x-hasura-role` and
`x-hasura-user-id`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/get-started/beta/console_query-with-permissions.png"
  alt="Query with authorization"
  width="1000px"
/>

## What did this do?

By adding `modelPermissions` we've declared that our `user` role only has access to the `Users` model. As you can see in
the screenshot above, this means _only_ this type is available to a consumer with the `x-hasura-role` value of `user`.

Further, we've limited which rows can be returned from this model by writing a check that will validate the
`x-hasura-user-id` value to that of the matching record with the same `id` in the data source.

Finally, we limited the fields they can access to the ones listed above, thereby preventing someone with the `user` role
accessing irrelevant system information, such as when they were last seen.

In the example above, we're passing these headers as unencoded values, but you can make these part of your claims when
utilizing [JWTs](/auth/authentication/jwt.mdx) or [webhooks](/auth/authentication/webhook.mdx) for authentication. You
can read more about Hasura's approach to authentication [here.](/auth/overview.mdx) However, we recommend you keep going
and check out the [custom business logic section](/getting-started/07-integrate-business-logic.mdx) next.
