# Add Authorization

## What's about to happen?

If you've already created and tested your supergraph, you'll have seen that queries are executed by default using the
`admin` role. However, you can easily add authorization rules — what we term permissions — by simply using the same
declarative metadata approach we've seen for relationships and versioning.

In the steps below, we'll add
[`modelPermissions`](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#modelpermissions-modelpermissions) to filter the data that can
be accessed by a role and [`typePermissions`](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#typepermissions-typepermissions) to
control what fields are returned by your API.

:::tip You can use the Hasura VS Code extension!

You can use the Hasura VS Code extension to help you author any metadata objects or updates, including
`modelPermissions` and `typePermissions`. You can activate its autocomplete abilities using `CTRL+SPACEBAR` inside of
any `hml` file.

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed](/getting-started/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- At least one [subgraph](/getting-started/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- At least one [data connector running](/getting-started/connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx)
- [Models added](/getting-started/connect-to-data/03-add-source-entities.mdx) to your subgraph

### Step 1. Create a modelPermission

By default, a role of `admin` exists for your API and can access all models. To create a new role, such as `editor`,
simply add the role to the list of `permissions` for a model and set up your access control rules. In the example below,
we'll allow users with the role of `editor` to access only their own rows from a `Users` model by checking for a header
value matching their `id`:

```yaml title="For example, in a Users.hml"
---
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Users
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
        #highlight-start
    - role: editor
      select:
        filter:
          fieldComparison:
            field: id
            operator: _eq
            value:
              sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
        #highlight-end
```

:::tip Where are models?

Remember, models are under the `metadata` subdirectory under the subgraph directory.

### Step 2. Create a typePermission

The `admin` role also has access to all fields for each model. However, adding a new role and limiting what columns can
be returned from your data source is just as simple. For example, let's restrict what a `editor` can see by omitting
several fields from the `typePermissions`:

```yaml title="For example, in a Users.hml"
---
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: Users
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - createdAt
          - email
          - favoriteArtist
          - id
          - isEmailVerified
          - lastSeen
          - name
          - password
          - updatedAt
    #highlight-start
    - role: user
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - email
          - favoriteArtist
          - id
          - name
          - password
    #highlight-end
```

### Step 3. Create a new build

As we've altered our metadata, create a new build to test it.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

:::tip Start your engines!

Want to test your supergraph? Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine and connectors using the following command.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat) docker compose up --build --watch
```

**If you haven't [included your connector(s)](/getting-started/01-init-supergraph.mdx) in your
`compose.yaml`, don't forget to start it as well.**

:::

Creating a new build after modifying this metadata will allow us to use two headers in our request: `x-hasura-role` and
`x-hasura-user-id`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/get-started/beta/console_query-with-permissions.png"
  alt="Query with authorization"
  width="1000px"
/>

## What did this do?

In our example, we're passing headers as unencoded values to control access and filtering for different roles.
Specifically, the `x-hasura-role` and `x-hasura-user-id` headers are used to manage permissions and data access. These
headers can be part of your claims when using [JWTs](/auth/authentication/jwt/index.mdx) or
[webhooks](/auth/authentication/webhook/index.mdx) for authentication. You can read more about Hasura's approach to
authentication [here](/auth/overview.mdx).

By adding `modelPermissions`, we've enabled access to the `Users` model for the `editor` role. As shown in the
screenshot above, this means that _only_ the `Users` model is available to a consumer with the `x-hasura-role` value of
`editor`.

Additionally, `modelPermissions` are used to filter the rows that can be returned from this model. They don't simply
check if the returned data is allowed; instead, they filter the data before it can be returned. In our example, this is
achieved by validating the `x-hasura-user-id` value against the matching record with the same `id` in the data source.

Finally, we limited the fields they can access to the ones listed above, thereby preventing someone with the `editor`
role from accessing irrelevant system information, such as when users were last seen.

[custom business logic section](/getting-started/07-integrate-business-logic.mdx) next.
