# Add Custom Business Logic

## What's about to happen?

As we alluded to in the beginning of this guide, the remaining work on top of your existing data source modeling is
authoring and maintaining custom code, or business logic. With Hasura, you can integrate — and even host — this business
logic directly with Hasura DDN and your API.

Hasura handles business logic using the TypeScript data connector. This enables you to author you own custom code,
written in TypeScript, and host it alongside your API. Using this connector, you can transform or enrich data before it
reaches your consumers, or perform any other app business logic you may need.

You can then integrate this custom code as individual [**commands**](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) in your
metadata. This process enables you to simplify client applications and speed up your backend development.

In this guide we will:

- Initialize the `hasura/nodejs` data connector
- Work with Node.js and npm to create a simple script
- Add a new `DataConnectorLink`
- Update the `DataConnectorLink` to track the function script as a command in our metadata
- Create a new API build and test it

## Steps

### Step 1. Initialize the TypeScript connector

Let's begin by initializing the connector on our project. In the example below, you'll see some familiar flags with new
values being passed to them. We'll call this the `ts_connector` and use the `hasura/nodejs` connector from the connector
hub:

```bash
ddn connector init my_ts --subgraph my_subgraph --hub-connector hasura/nodejs
```

This will create the following file structure in a `my_subgraph/connector/my_ts` directory, with the `functions.ts`
file being your connector's entrypoint:

```bash
.
├── .ddnignore
├── .env.local
├── .hasura-connector
├── connector.yaml
├── docker-compose.my_ts.yaml
# highlight-start
├── functions.ts
# highlight-end
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### Step 2. Modify the connector's port

Add the port's value to the `my_subgraph/connector/my_ts/.env.local` in your `my_ts` directory:

```env
HASURA_CONNECTOR_PORT=8083
```

### Step 3. Add the DataConnectorLink

As with any other connector, we'll now need to create the `DataConnectorLink` which will translate our TypeScript
functions into commands that can be exposed as queries and mutations via our GraphQL API. Create this using:

```bash
ddn connector-link add my_ts
```

Then, update the values in your subgraph's `.env.my_subgraph` file to include this connector.

```env
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_TS_READ_URL=http://local.hasura.dev:<port>
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_TS_WRITE_URL=http://local.hasura.dev:<port>
```

These values are already referenced in `my_subgraph/metadata/my_ts/my_ts.hml`.

### Step 4. Install npm package dependencies

Within our `my_ts` directory, let's install any necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd my_subgraph/connector/my_ts && npm i
```

Then, from the `my_ts` directory run this command to use the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from the `.
env.local` file, start the connector, and watch for any changes:

```bash
npx dotenv -e .env.local -- npm run watch
```

:::info Node.js version and Permissions

The `hasura/nodejs` connector uses Node.js version `>=20`. Please make sure you have the correct version installed.

If you get a warning about needing permissions to install globally, you can use `sudo` to install the package with
your user system password:

```bash
sudo npm install -g dotenv-cli
```

:::

### Step 5. Write business logic

In this simple example, we're going to transform a timestamp with timezone (eg: "2024-03-14T08:00:00Z") into a nicely
formatted version for humans, eg: "8am, Thursday, March 14th, 2024."

We'll replace the default `hello()` function in our `functions.ts` file with the following:

```ts
/**
 * @readonly
 */
export async function formatTimezoneDate(dateString: string): Promise<string> {
  const date = new Date(dateString);

  const day = date.getDate();
  const nth = (d: number) => {
    if (d > 3 && d < 21) return "th";
    switch (d % 10) {
      case 1:
        return "st";
      case 2:
        return "nd";
      case 3:
        return "rd";
      default:
        return "th";
    }
  };

  const hours = date.getHours();
  const ampm = hours >= 12 ? "pm" : "am";
  const hour = hours % 12 || 12;

  const dayOfWeek = date.toLocaleString("en-US", { weekday: "long" });
  const month = date.toLocaleString("en-US", { month: "long" });
  const year = date.getFullYear();

  return `${hour}${ampm}, ${dayOfWeek}, ${month} ${day}${nth(day)}, ${year}.`;
}
```

As this is a Node.js project, you can install any dependency!

### Step 6. Track the new function

To add our function, similar to how we added our individual tables earlier, we can use the following to generate the
related Hasura metadata:

```bash
ddn connector-link update my_ts --subgraph my_subgraph --add-all-resources
```

### Step 7. Create a new API build and test

Next, let's create a new build of our supergraph:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

:::tip Start your engines!

Want to test your supergraph? Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine and connectors using the following command:

```bash
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn internal print-pat) docker compose -f docker-compose.hasura.yaml watch
```

:::

You should see your command available, along with its documentation, in the GraphiQL explorer which you should be
able to access at `https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql?url=http://localhost:3000`.

## What did this do?

The commands above initialized a new TypeScript connector, installed dependencies, and created a new function to format
a timestamp with timezone into a human-readable format. We then added this function to our metadata as a command, and
created a new build of our supergraph.

## Next Steps

You can also create relationships between types in your supergraph and your commands. This enables you to pair custom
business logic with — for example — database tables, and then transform or enrich data before sending it back to your
consumers.

You can learn more about creating these and other relationships on the
[next page](/getting-started/08-create-a-relationship.mdx), or you can learn about
[mutating data](/getting-started/09-mutate-data.mdx) using the TypeScript connector.
