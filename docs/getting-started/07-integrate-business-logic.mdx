# Add Custom Business Logic

## What's about to happen?

As we alluded to in the beginning of this guide, the remaining work on top of your existing data source modeling is
authoring and maintaining custom code, or business logic. With Hasura, you can integrate — and even host — this business
logic directly with Hasura DDN and your API.

Hasura handles business logic using the TypeScript data connector. This enables you to author you own custom code,
written in TypeScript, and host it alongside your API. Using this connector, you can transform or enrich data before it
reaches your consumers, or perform any other app business logic you may need.

You can then integrate this custom code as individual [**commands**](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) in your
metadata. This process enables you to simplify client applications and speed up your backend development.

In this guide we will:

- Initialize the `hasura/nodejs` data connector
- Work with Node.js and npm to create a simple script
- Add a new `DataConnectorLink`
- Update the `DataConnectorLink` to track the function script as a command in our metadata
- Create a new API build and test it

## Steps

### Step 1. Initialize the TypeScript connector

Let's begin by initializing the connector on our project. In the example below, you'll see some familiar flags with new
values being passed to them. We'll call this the `ts_connector` and use the `hasura/nodejs` connector from the connector
hub:

```bash
ddn connector init my_ts --dir <subgraph-name>/connector/my_ts --hub-connector hasura/nodejs
```

This will create the following directory structure in your subgraph's connector directory's new `my_ts` directory, with
the `functions.ts` file being your connector's entrypoint:

```bash
.
├── .ddnignore
├── .env.local
├── .hasura-connector
├── connector.yaml
├── docker-compose.my_ts.yaml
# highlight-start
├── functions.ts
# highlight-end
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

:::tip Modify the connector's published port

Like with other connectors, to avoid port collisions, we can change the connector's published port to something else. In
the `docker-compose.my_ts.yaml` file, which can be found in the directory you created in the last step, replace the
existing `published` value with:

```yaml
ports:
  - mode: ingress
    target: 8080
    #highlight-start
    published: "8083"
    #highlight-end
    protocol: tcp
```

Then, add the port's value to the `.env.local` in your `my_ts` directory:

```env
HASURA_CONNECTOR_PORT=8083
```

:::

### Step 2. Install npm package dependencies

Within our `my_ts` directory, let's install any necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd <subgraph>/connector/my_ts && npm i
```

Then, from the `my_ts` directory run this command to start and watch the connector for any changes:

```bash
dotenv -e .env.local -- npm run watch
```

### Step 3. Write business logic

In this simple example, we're going to transform a timestamp with timezone (eg: "2024-03-14T08:00:00Z") into a nicely
formatted version for humans, eg: "8am, Thursday, March 14th, 2024."

We'll replace the default `hello()` function in our `functions.ts` file with the following:

```ts
/**
 * @readonly
 */
export async function formatTimezoneDate(dateString: string): Promise<string> {
  const date = new Date(dateString);
  const options: Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions = {
    weekday: "long",
    year: "numeric",
    month: "long",
    day: "numeric",
    hour: "numeric",
    minute: "numeric",
    timeZoneName: "short",
  };

  const day = date.getDate();
  const nth = (d: number) => {
    if (d > 3 && d < 21) return "th";
    switch (d % 10) {
      case 1:
        return "st";
      case 2:
        return "nd";
      case 3:
        return "rd";
      default:
        return "th";
    }
  };

  const hours = date.getHours();
  const minutes = date.getMinutes();
  const ampm = hours >= 12 ? "pm" : "am";
  const hour = hours % 12 || 12;
  const minute = minutes.toString().padStart(2, "0");

  const dayOfWeek = date.toLocaleString("en-US", { weekday: "long" });
  const month = date.toLocaleString("en-US", { month: "long" });
  const year = date.getFullYear();

  return `${hour}${ampm}, ${dayOfWeek}, ${month} ${day}${nth(day)}, ${year}.`;
}
```

:::tip Install any dependency and use environment variables

As this is a Node.js project, you can install any dependency!

You can also utilize any environment variable which is stored in the `.env.local` file in the `my_ts` subdirectory. You
can add any values here that you'd like and reference them in your functions. Add the dotenv-cli globally so that you
can load environment variables from your `.env.local` file:

```bash
npm i -g dotenv-cli
```

:::

### Step 4. Add the DataConnectorLink

As with any other connector, we'll now need to create the `DataConnectorLink` which will translate our TypeScript
functions into commands that can be exposed as queries and mutations via our GraphQL API. Create this using:

```bash
ddn connector-link add my_ts
```

Then, update the values in your subgraph's `.env.<subgraph-name>` file to include this connector.

```env
UX_MY_TS_READ_URL=http://local.hasura.dev:8083
UX_MY_TS_WRITE_URL=http://local.hasura.dev:8083
```

### Step 5. Track the new function

To add our function, similar to how we added our individual tables earlier, we can use the following to generate the
related Hasura metadata:

```bash
ddn connector-link update my_ts --subgraph <subgraph-name> --add-all-resources
```

### Step 6. Create a new API build and test

Next, let's create a new build of our supergraph:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

:::tip Start your engines!

Want to test your supergraph? Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine and connectors using the following command:

```bash
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn internal print-pat) docker compose -f docker-compose.hasura.yaml watch
```

:::

You should see your command available, along with its documentation, in the GraphiQL explorer.

## What did this do?

The commands above initialized a new TypeScript connector, installed dependencies, and created a new function to format
a timestamp with timezone into a human-readable format. We then added this function to our metadata as a command, and
created a new build of our supergraph.

## Next Steps

You can also create relationships between types in your supergraph and your commands. This enables you to pair custom
business logic with — for example — database tables, and then transform or enrich data before sending it back to your
consumers.

You can learn more about creating these and other relationships on the
[next page](/getting-started/08-create-a-relationship.mdx), or you can learn about
[mutating data](/getting-started/09-mutate-data.mdx) using the TypeScript connector.
