# Add Custom Business Logic

## What's about to happen?

As we alluded to in the beginning of this guide, the remaining work on top of your existing data source modeling is
authoring and maintaining custom code, or business logic. With Hasura, you can integrate — and even host — this business
logic directly with Hasura DDN and your API.

Hasura handles business logic using the TypeScript connector. This enables you to author you own custom code, written in
TypeScript, and host it alongside your API. Using this connector, you can transform and enrich data before it reaches
your consumers, unlocking you to simplify client applications and speed up your backend development.

You can then integrate this custom code as individual [**commands**](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) in your
metadata.

In the example below, you'll...

## Steps

### Step 1. Add the TypeScript connector

Let's begin by adding the connector to our project. In the example below, you'll see some familiar flags with new values
being passed to them. We'll call this the `ts_connector` and use the `hasura/nodejs` connector from the connector hub:

```bash
ddn connector init myts --dir <subgraph-name>/connector/myts --hub-connector hasura/nodejs
```

This will create the following directory structure in your subgraph's connector directory's new `myts` directory, with
the `functions.ts` file being your connector's entrypoint:

```bash
├── connector.yaml
├── docker-compose.myts.yaml
#highlight-start
├── functions.ts
#highlight-end
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### Step 2. Modify the connector's published port

Like with our PostgreSQL connector, to avoid port collisions, we'll change the connector's published port to `8083`. In
the `docker-compose.myts.yaml` file, which can be found in the directory you created in the last step, replace the
existing `published` value with:

```yaml
ports:
  - mode: ingress
    target: 8080
    #highlight-start
    published: "8083"
    #highlight-end
    protocol: tcp
```

Then, add the port's value to the `.env.local` in your `myts` directory:

```env
HASURA_CONNECTOR_PORT=8083
```

### Step 3. Install dependencies

Within our `myts` directory, let's install any necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd <subgraph>/connector/myts && npm i
```

Additionally, we'll add the dotenv-cli globally so we can load environment variables from our `.env.local` file:

```bash
npm i -g dotenv-cli
```

Then, from the `myts` directory run this command to start and watch the connector for any changes:

```bash
dotenv -e .env.local -- npm run watch
```

### Step 4. Add the DataConnectorLink

As with our PostgreSQL connector, and any connector, we'll now need to create the `DataConnectorLink` which will
translate our TypeScript functions into commands that can be exposed as queries and mutations via our GraphQL API.
Create this using:

```bash
ddn connector-link add myts
```

Then, update the values in your subgraph's `.env.<subgraph-name>` file to include this connector. The complete file
should now look like this, as an example with an existing PostgreSQL connector in a `ux` subgraph:

```env
UX_MYPG_READ_URL=http://local.hasura.dev:8082
UX_MYPG_WRITE_URL=http://local.hasura.dev:8082
UX_MYTS_READ_URL=http://local.hasura.dev:8083
UX_MYTS_WRITE_URL=http://local.hasura.dev:8083
```

### Step 5. Write business logic

In our example, we're going to transform the timestamp returned on our `createdAt` field from `Users` into a
human-readable format. For convenience, we're also demonstrating a PostgreSQL example here, but you can integrate these
functions with whatever data source you wish.

We'll replace the default `hello()` function in our `functions.ts` file with the following:

```ts
import { Client } from "pg";
import { config } from "dotenv";

config();

/**
 * @readonly
 */
export async function humanReadableCreatedAt(userId: string): Promise<string> {
  const client = new Client({
    connectionString: process.env.PG_URI,
  });

  await client.connect();

  const queryText = "SELECT created_at FROM users WHERE id = $1";
  const result = await client.query(queryText, [userId]);

  if (result.rows.length > 0) {
    const timestamp = result.rows[0].created_at;
    const date = new Date(timestamp);
    return date.toLocaleString();
  } else {
    return `Issue retrieving user`;
  }
}
```

:::tip Install any dependency and use environment varialbes

As this is a Node.js project, you can install any dependency! You can see we've installed the `dotenv` and `pg` packages
and are using the latter to interact directly with a PostgreSQL data source. **However, you can modify this to be any
package you wish to use with your data source.**

You'll also notice that we're using `process.env.PG_URI`, which references the `.env.local` file in the `myts`
subdirectory. You can add any values here you'd like and reference them in your functions.

### Step 6. Track the new function

To add our function, similar to how we added our individual tables earlier, we can use the following to generate the
related Hasura metadata:

```bash
ddn connector-link update myts --subgraph <subgraph-name> --add-all-resources
```

### Step 7. Create a new build and test

Next, let's create a new build of our supergraph:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

You should see your command available, along with its documentation, in the GraphiQL explorer:

  alt="Command as a query in GraphiQL"
  width="1000px"
/>

## What did this do?

You just...

You can also create relationships between types in your supergraph and your commands. This enables you to pair custom
business logic with — for example — database tables, and then transform or enrich data before sending it back to your
consumers.

You can learn more about creating these and other relationships on the
[next page](/getting-started/08-create-a-relationship.mdx), or you can learn about
[mutating data](/getting-started/09-mutate-data.mdx) using the TypeScript connector.
