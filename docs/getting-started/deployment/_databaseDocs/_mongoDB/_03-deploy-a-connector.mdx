## What's about to happen?

Connectors are deployed independently of your supergraph and of each other. Hasura DDN will host your connectors for
you, ensuring rapid delivery of data from your API to your consumers. **For each connector in a project, follow the
steps below.**

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [data connector](/getting-started/build/connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)

### Step 1. Update the .env.cloud for the connector

As we did with the `env.local` file, we need to update the `env.cloud` file with any connection URI we need for the
cloud hosted connector to be able to communicate with the MongoDB data source.

For example, you may have used a development database while iterating locally. You can now replace that value with your
staging or production database, depending on your needs.

```env title="For example, my_subgraph/my_mongo/.env.cloud"
MONGODB_DATABASE_URI="mongodb+srv://<your-mongodb-connection-string>"
```

This key will depend on your connector.

### Step 2. Build and deploy your cloud connector

At this stage, you can now build and deploy your connector Hasura DDN. Simply run the following replacing the directory
names with those that reflect your project.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn connector build create --connector ./my_subgraph/connector/my_mongo/connector.cloud.yaml
```

The CLI will respond with read and write URLs for your deployed connector.

### Step 3. Create a .env.cloud for the subgraph

If you haven't already deployed a connector for a subgraph, you'll need to create a `.env.cloud.my_subgraph` file in the
root directory of the subgraph which contains your connector. Within this, you'll add the cloud connector's URLs like
this example with a connector named `my_mongo` in the `my_subgraph` subgraph.

```env title="For example, my_subgraph/.env.cloud.my_subgraph:"
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_MONGO_READ_URL=<cloud-connector-read-url>
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_MONGO_WRITE_URL=<cloud-connector-write-url>
```

At this stage, you're ready to now build and deploy your supergraph!

## What did this do?

The steps above built and deployed your data connector to Hasura DDN. So long as the connection URI you provided is
reachable by DDN, your connector will be able to communicate between your API and your data source.

## Next steps

If you have other connectors needed for a supergraph, repeat these steps for each connector. Otherwise, you're ready to
[create a new build of your supergraph](/getting-started/deployment/04-deploy-your-supergraph.mdx) and deploy it to
Hasura DDN!
