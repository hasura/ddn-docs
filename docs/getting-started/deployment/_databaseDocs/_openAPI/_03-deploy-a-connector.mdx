## What's about to happen?

Connectors are deployed independently of your supergraph and of each other. Hasura DDN will host your connectors for
you, ensuring rapid delivery of data from your API to your consumers. **For each OpenAPI connector in a project, follow
the steps below.**

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [data connector](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph on Hasura DDN](/getting-started/deployment/02-create-a-subgraph.mdx)

### Step 1. Update the .env.cloud for the connector

### Specifying the OpenAPI base URL

We need our cloud hosted connector to be able to communicate with the OpenAPI API. If we added this URI via an
environment variable in the `env.local` file, we need to update the `env.cloud` file with the connection URI for the
cloud hosted connector. Eg:

```env title="For example, my_subgraph/my_openapi/.env.cloud"
NDC_OAS_BASE_URL=<your-openapi-base-url>
```

Eg: `NDC_OAS_BASE_URL=https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3` However, if you've edited this directly in your
`functions.ts` file, you can skip this step.

You may have used a development API server while iterating locally. You can now replace that value with your staging or
production API server, depending on your needs.

### Step 1. Build and deploy your cloud connector

You can now build and deploy your connector to Hasura DDN. Simply run the following, replacing the directory names with
those that reflect your project.

```bash title="Taking care to update the path to your connector's configuration file, run:"
ddn connector build create --connector ./my_subgraph/connector/my_openapi/connector.yaml
```

The CLI will respond with read and write URLs for your deployed connector.

### Step 3. Create a .env.cloud for the subgraph

If you haven't already deployed a connector for this subgraph, you'll need to create a `.env.cloud.my_subgraph` file in
the root directory of the subgraph which contains your connector. Within this, you'll add the cloud connector's URLs
which were returned from the command above. Your file should look like this example with a connector named `my_openapi`
in the `my_subgraph` subgraph.

```env title="For example, my_subgraph/.env.cloud.my_subgraph:"
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_OPENAPI_READ_URL=<cloud-connector-read-url>
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_OPENAPI_WRITE_URL=<cloud-connector-write-url>
```

:::tip Deploy to a specific region

If you want to deploy your connector to a specific data center region you can
[follow the steps on this page](/connectors/region-routing.mdx).

At this stage, you're ready to now build and deploy your supergraph!

## What did this do?

The steps above built and deployed your data connector to Hasura DDN. So long as the connection URI you provided is
reachable by DDN, your connector will be able to communicate between your API and your data source.

## Next steps

If you have other connectors needed for a supergraph, repeat these steps for each connector. Otherwise, you're ready to
[create a new build of your supergraph](/getting-started/deployment/04-deploy-your-supergraph.mdx) and deploy it to
Hasura DDN!
