## What's about to happen?

Connectors are deployed independently of your supergraph and of each other. Hasura DDN will host your connectors for
you, ensuring rapid delivery of data from your API to your consumers. **For each GraphQL connector in a project, follow
the steps below.**

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [data connector](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph on Hasura DDN](/getting-started/deployment/02-create-a-subgraph.mdx)

### Step 1. Build and deploy your cloud connector

Simply run the following replacing the directory names with those that reflect your project.

```bash title="Taking care to update the path to your connector's configuration file, run:"
ddn connector build create --connector ./my_subgraph/connector/my_graphql/connector.yaml
```

The CLI will respond with read and write URLs for your deployed connector.

In this command we're passing a few arguments:

- `--connector` specifies the path to the connector's cloud configuration file which we want to build.
- `--target-env-file` specifies the path to the subgraph's cloud environment file to which the read and write URLs for
  the newly built cloud connector will be written to.
- `--target-subgraph` specifies the path to the subgraph's configuration yaml file to which the target env file belongs.
- `--target-connector-link` where the latest schema for the connector will be updated.

:::tip Deploy to a specific region

If you want to deploy your connector to a specific data center region you can
[follow the steps on this page](/graphql-api/region-routing.mdx).

You're now ready to build and deploy your supergraph!

## What did this do?

The steps above built and deployed your GraphQL connector to Hasura DDN.

## Next steps

If you have other connectors needed for a supergraph, repeat these steps for each connector. Otherwise, you're ready to
[create a new build of your supergraph](/getting-started/deployment/04-deploy-your-supergraph.mdx) and deploy it to
Hasura DDN!
