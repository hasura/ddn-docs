## What's about to happen?

Connectors are deployed independently of your supergraph and of each other. Hasura DDN will host your connectors for
you, ensuring rapid delivery of data from your API to your consumers. **For each TypeScript connector in a project,
follow the steps below.**

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/getting-started/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [data connector](/getting-started/connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph on Hasura DDN](/getting-started/deployment/02-create-a-subgraph.mdx)

### Step 1. Build and deploy your cloud connector

You can now build and deploy your connector on Hasura DDN. Simply run the following replacing the directory names
with those that reflect your project if necessary.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn connector build create --connector ./my_subgraph/connector/my_ts/connector.cloud.yaml
```

The CLI will respond with read and write URLs for your deployed connector.

### Step 3. Create a .env.cloud for the subgraph

If you haven't already deployed a connector for a subgraph, you'll need to create a `.env.cloud.my_subgraph` file in the
root directory of the subgraph which contains your connector. Within this, you'll add the cloud connector's URLs like
this example:

```env title="For example, my_subgraph/.env.cloud.my_subgraph:"
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_TS_READ_URL=<cloud-connector-read-url>
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_TS_WRITE_URL=<cloud-connector-write-url>
```

At this stage, you're ready to now build and deploy your supergraph!

## What did this do?

The steps above built and deployed your TypeScript connector to Hasura DDN. This means you can now use this connector to
enrich or transform data on your DDN-hotsed supergraph ðŸŽ‰

## Next steps

If you have other connectors needed for a supergraph, repeat these steps for each connector. Otherwise, you're ready to
[create a new build of your supergraph](/getting-started/deployment/04-deploy-your-supergraph.mdx) and deploy it to
Hasura DDN!
