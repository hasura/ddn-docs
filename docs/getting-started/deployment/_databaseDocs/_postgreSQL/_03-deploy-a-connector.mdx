## What's about to happen?

Connectors are deployed independently of your supergraph and of each other. Hasura DDN will host your connectors for
you, ensuring rapid delivery of data from your API to your consumers. **For each PostgreSQL connector in a project,
follow the steps below.**

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/getting-started/build/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [data connector](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph on Hasura DDN](/getting-started/deployment/02-create-a-subgraph.mdx)

### Step 1. Update the root `.env.cloud`

We need to update the root `env.cloud` file with the connection URI we need for the cloud hosted connector to be able to
communicate with the PostgreSQL data source.

For example, you may have used a development database while iterating locally. You can now replace that value with your
staging or production database, depending on your needs.

If you've been running a local PostgreSQL instance, you can replace the connection string with a cloud instance
connection string or set up an [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) tunnel to a local instance.

```env title="For example, ./.env.cloud"
CONNECTION_URI=<postgres-connection-uri>
```

### Step 2. Build and deploy your cloud connector

At this stage, you can now build and deploy your connector on Hasura DDN. Simply run the following replacing the
directory names with those that reflect your project.

```bash title="Taking care to update the path to your connector's configuration file, run:"
ddn connector build create --connector ./my_subgraph/connector/my_pg/connector.yaml
```

The CLI will respond with read and write URLs for your deployed connector.

In this command we're passing the `--connector` argument, which specifies the path to the connector's configuration file
which we want to build.

:::tip Deploy to multiple regions

If you want to deploy your PostgreSQL connector to a multiple data center regions you can use configuration in your
`Connector` object in metadata as described in our
[multi-region routing guide](/connectors/region-routing.mdx#multi-region-routing).

## What did this do?

The steps above built and deployed your PostgreSQL connector to Hasura DDN. So long as the connection URI you provided
is reachable by DDN, your connector will be able to communicate between your API and your data source.

## Next steps

If you have other connectors needed for a supergraph, repeat these steps for each connector. Otherwise, you're ready to
[create a new build of your supergraph](/getting-started/deployment/04-deploy-your-supergraph.mdx) and deploy it to
Hasura DDN!
