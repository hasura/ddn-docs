# Deploy a Connector

Connectors are deployed independently of your supergraph and of each other. Hasura DDN will host your connectors for
you, ensuring rapid delivery of data from your API to your consumers. **For each connector in a project, follow the
steps below:**

## Step 1. Create a cloud.connector.yaml

Each connector utilizes a `connector.yaml` file for local development. When deploying a connector, start by creating a
`cloud.connector.yaml` file in the same directory as the connector's local `connector.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: Connector
version: v1
definition:
  project: <project-name>
  name: mypg
  subgraph: <subgraph-name>
  source: hasura/<connector-name>:<version>
  context: .
  envFile: .env.cloud
```

Ensure the project name matches the current project and that you correctly assign the subgraph to which the connector
belongs.

## Step 2. Create a .env.cloud for the connector

As the database you've used for development may be different from that which you wish to use on Hasura DDN — be it for
staging or production — you'll now provide the connection string, just like in your `.env.local`, for the database you
wish to use on Hasura DDN. Create a `.env.cloud` environment variable file in the same directory and add the connection
string for your PostgreSQL database:

```env
CONNECTION_URI=<connection-uri-to-postgresql>
```

## Step 3. Build and deploy your cloud connector

At this stage, you can now build and deploy your connector Hasura DDN. Simply run the following replacing the directory
names with those that reflect your project:

```bash
ddn connector build create --connector ./<subgraph>/connector/<connector-name>/cloud.connector.yaml
```

The CLI will respond with read and write URLs for your deployed connector.

## Step 4. Create a .env.cloud for the subgraph

If you haven't already deployed a connector for a subgraph, you'll need to create a `.env.cloud.<subgraph-name>` file in
the root directory of the subgraph which contains your connector. Within this, you'll add the cloud connector's URLs
like this example with a connector named `mypg` in the `ux` subgraph:

```env
# /ux/.env.cloud.ux
UX_MYPG_READ_URL=<cloud-connector-read-url>
UX_MYPG_WRITE_URL=<cloud-connector-write-url>
```

At this stage, you're read to now build and deploy your supergraph!
