# Deploy

To deploy your API, you need to collectively deploy your connectors and supergraph. Hasura DDN can host these for you,
enabling easy management via the Hasura Console on Hasura DDN. We'll follow these steps over the next several pages:

1. Create a project on Hasura DDN.
2. Deploy each connector you've used to connect data (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TypeScript).
3. Deploy your supergraph.
