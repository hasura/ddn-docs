# Create a Subgraph

## What's about to happen?

You're about to create a subgraph on Hasura DDN.

Subgraphs can be rebuilt at any point to reflect changes made in connectors or other metadata related to models,
commands, relationships, or permissions. To do so, you'll need complete the first two steps once and then, for each
additional cloud build, you'll only need to complete the third step.

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- [Project context set](/getting-started/deployment/create-a-project#step-2-set-the-project-context) via the CLI

:::

For each subgraph you're deploying, run the following to create it on Hasura DDN, replacing `my_subgraph` with your
desired name:

```bash title="From any project directory, run:"
ddn project subgraph create my_subgraph
```

## What did this do?

Seemingly, this was an unimpressive step. However, subgraphs in your local metadata will map to resources on Hasura DDN.
Thus, for each subgraph you have in local metadata, you'll create the companion on Hasura DDN.

## Next steps

With a subgraph provisioned on Hasura DDN, you can now begin
[building and deploying your connectors](/getting-started/deployment/deploy-a-connector) to Hasura DDN.
