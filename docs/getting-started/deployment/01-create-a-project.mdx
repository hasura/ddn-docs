# Create a Project

## What's about to happen?

We're going to create a project on Hasura DDN.

[**Projects**](/project-configuration/projects.mdx) contain all the configuration and metadata for your supergraph. A
project will contain exactly one supergraph. When you create a project, you're creating a resource on Hasura DDN.
Eventually, this can be used to serve your API.

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)

## Steps

### Step 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating the project on Hasura DDN.

```bash title="From any directory, run:"
ddn project create
```

<details>
  <summary>This command will return the project name and the console URL for your project:</summary>

```bash title="Example output:"
4:19PM INF Project "cool-cat-3685" created on Hasura DDN successfully
+-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Name        |                                      cool-cat-3685 |
+-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Console URL | https://console.hasura.io/project/causal-worm-3685 |
+-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
```

</details>

### Step 2. Set the project context

As a convenience feature — and to prevent the need to pass the flag with every command — we can set the project context
using this command with the value returned from the CLI in the previous command.

```bash title="From any project directory, run:"
ddn context set project <project-name>
```

## What did this do?

The CLI provisioned a new project for you on Hasura DDN and then returned the project name and console URL for your
project. You then used the `context set project` command to give the CLI context as to which DDN project this local
directory is connected.

## Next steps

Now that your local metadata is mapped to a project on Hasura DDN, you can
[begin to create](/getting-started/deployment/create-a-subgraph) your subgraphs on Hasura DDN as well.
