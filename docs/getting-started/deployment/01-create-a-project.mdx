# Create a Project

## What's about to happen?

We're going to create a project on Hasura DDN.

[**Projects**](/project-configuration/projects.mdx) contain all the configuration and metadata for your supergraph. A
project will contain exactly one supergraph. When you create a project, you're creating a resource on Hasura DDN.
Eventually, this can be used to serve your API.

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/01-init-supergraph.mdx)

:::

## Steps

### Step 1. Create a project

To create a project, run the following command:

```bash
ddn project create
```

### Step 2. Set the project context

As a convenience feature — and to prevent the need to pass the flag with every command — we can set the project context
using this command with the value returned from the CLI in the previous command:

```bash
ddn context set project <project-name>
```

## What did this do?

The CLI provisioned a new project for you on Hasura DDN and then returned the project name and console URL for your
project. Now, you can take the name returned and add it to your `supergraph.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: Supergraph
version: v1
definition:
  project: <project-name>
# other configuration below
```

## Next steps

Now that your local metadata is mapped to a project on Hasura DDN, you can
[begin to create](/getting-started/deployment/create-a-subgraph) your subgraphs on Hasura DDN as well.
