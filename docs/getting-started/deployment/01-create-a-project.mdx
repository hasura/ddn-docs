# Create a Project

## What's about to happen?

We're going to create a project on Hasura DDN.

[**Projects**](/project-configuration/projects.mdx) contain all the configuration and metadata for your supergraph. A
project will contain exactly one supergraph. When you create a project, you're creating a resource on Hasura DDN.
Eventually, this can be used to serve your API.

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/build/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/build/01-init-supergraph.mdx)

## Steps

### Step 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating the project on Hasura DDN.

```bash title="From any directory, run:"
ddn project init
```

<details>
  <summary>This command will return the project name and the console URL for your project:</summary>

```bash title="Example output:"
4:19PM INF Project "cool-cat-3685" created on Hasura DDN successfully
+-----------+---------------+
| Project   | fast-pug-7230 |
+-----------+---------------+
| Subgraphs | globals,app   |
+-----------+---------------+
```

</details>

#### What did this do?

The CLI did a lot under the hood:

- It provisioned a new project for you on Hasura DDN and then returned the project name and console URL for your
  project.
- This command also set context so this local project is mapped to the newly-created Hasura DDN project.
- The CLI created a new `.env.cloud` file for variables to be used in your hosted project.
- It created subgraphs from your existing local project for the project on Hasura DDN.

### Step 2. Add your environment variables

For each connector with a connection string, you'll need a key-value pair added in your `.env.cloud` file.

```env title="For example, if we have a MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_PG_CONNECTION_URI variable, we'll need to add the connection string here:"
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_PG_CONNECTION_URI="postgresql://read_only_user:readonlyuser@35.236.11.122:5432/v3-docs-sample-app"
```

This value can be different from the connection string used in your local `.env` and should be mapped to whatever data
source you intend to use with your deployed API.

### Step 3. Deploy your supergraph

You're ready to deploy your supergraph! The following command will build and deploy your data connectors, update the
connectors' URLs in your `.env.cloud` file, and â€” finally â€” create a new build of your supergraph and deploy it ðŸŽ‰

```bash title="Run:"
ddn supergraph build create
```

## Next steps

After you check out your newly-deployed supergraph, we recommend applying a build so it's served by your project. You
can do that from the `GraphiQL` tab of the console, or using the CLI.

```bash title="First, get the list of all builds:"
ddn supergraph build get
```

After the CLI returns the list of builds, you can apply one using its build version:

```bash title="Pass a build version to apply it:"
ddn supergraph build apply <supergraph-build-version>
```
