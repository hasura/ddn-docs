# Create a Project

[**Projects**](/project-configuration/projects.mdx) contain all the configuration and metadata for your supergraph. A
project will contain exactly one supergraph. When you create a project, you're creating a resource on Hasura DDN.
Eventually, this can be used to serve your API. To create a project, run the following command:

```bash
ddn project create
```

The CLI will return the project name and console URL for your project. Now, you can take the name returned and add it to
your `supergraph.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: Supergraph
version: v1
definition:
  project: <project-name>
# other configuration below
```
