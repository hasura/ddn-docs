# Deploy a Connector

## What's about to happen?

Connectors are deployed independently of your supergraph and of each other. Hasura DDN will host your connectors for
you, ensuring rapid delivery of data from your API to your consumers. **For each connector in a project, follow the
steps below.**

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/00-prerequisites.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/getting-started/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/getting-started/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- A new or existing [data connector](/getting-started/connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/getting-started/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)

### Step 1. Create a cloud.connector.yaml

Each connector utilizes a `connector.yaml` file for local development. When deploying a connector, start by creating a
`connector.cloud.yaml` file in the same directory as the connector's local `connector.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: Connector
version: v1
definition:
  name: <connector-name>
  subgraph: <subgraph-name>
  source: hasura/<connector-type>:<version>
  context: .
  envFile: .env.cloud
```

### Step 2. Create a .env.cloud for the connector

As the database you've used for development may be different from that which you wish to use on Hasura DDN — be it for
staging or production — you'll now provide the connection string, just like in your `.env.local`, for the database you
wish to use on Hasura DDN. Create a `.env.cloud` environment variable file in the same directory and add the connection
string for your database:

```env
CONNECTION_URI=<connection-uri>
```

### Step 3. Build and deploy your cloud connector

At this stage, you can now build and deploy your connector Hasura DDN. Simply run the following replacing the directory
names with those that reflect your project:

```bash
ddn connector build create --connector ./<subgraph>/connector/<connector-name>/connector.cloud.yaml
```

The CLI will respond with read and write URLs for your deployed connector.

### Step 4. Create a .env.cloud for the subgraph

If you haven't already deployed a connector for a subgraph, you'll need to create a `.env.cloud.<subgraph-name>` file in
the root directory of the subgraph which contains your connector. Within this, you'll add the cloud connector's URLs
like this example with a connector named `my_pg` in the `ux` subgraph:

```env
# /ux/.env.cloud.ux
UX_MY_PG_READ_URL=<cloud-connector-read-url>
UX_MY_PG_WRITE_URL=<cloud-connector-write-url>
```

At this stage, you're ready to now build and deploy your supergraph!

## What did this do?

The steps above built and deployed your data connector to Hasura DDN. So long as the connection URI you provided is
reachable by DDN, your connector will be able to communicate between your API and your data source.

## Next steps

If you have other connectors needed for a supergraph, repeat these steps for each connector. Otherwise, you're ready to
[create a new build of your supergraph](/getting-started/deployment/04-deploy-your-supergraph.mdx) and deploy it to
Hasura DDN!
