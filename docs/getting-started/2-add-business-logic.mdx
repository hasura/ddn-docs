# Add Business Logic

## Introduction

With DDN, Hasura introduces a new way of writing custom business logic using connectors. We can expose generic functions
or procedures that can be added to metadata as a [command](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx), which can be made
available over your GraphQL API as a query or a mutation.

Let's take a look at doing this with the
[Node.js Lambda Connector with TypeScript](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-nodejs-lambda).

## Step 1: Navigate to the TypeScript connector

When we ran `ddn quickstart`, we told the CLI that we wanted to include the TypeScript connector. Inside of the
`/app/app_functions` directory we can find all the files the CLI generated, including `functions.ts` which will contain
our custom logic:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ builds
# highlight-start
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ functions.ts
# highlight-end
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app_functions.build.hml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â””â”€â”€ app_functions.hml
```

If we open `functions.ts`, we'll see the following contents:

```ts
/**
 * @readonly Exposes the function as an NDC function (the function should only query data without making modifications)
 */
export function hello(name?: string) {
  return `hello ${name ?? "world"}`;
}
```

We can use this in our API by running the following query, **assuming we removed the `x-hasura-role` and
`x-hasura-user-id` headers we added on the previous page**:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  app_hello(name: "Hasura")
}
```

Which should return:

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "app_hello": "hello Hasura"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Make some changes

Since we're running `ddn dev`, the CLI generated a tunnel between this locally running TypeScript connector and our API
hosted on Hasura DDN. This means any changes we make will trigger a new build and instantly be available via our API.
Let's modify `hello()` to the following:

```ts
/**
 * @readonly Exposes the function as an NDC function (the function should only query data without making modifications)
 */
export function hello(name?: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name ?? "World"}! ðŸ‘‹`;
}
```

Now, if we re-run our query, we should see nearly the same message...just with a bit more gusto!

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "app_hello": "Hello, Hasura! ðŸ‘‹"
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Create and track a new function

Of course, our API will need more than one function. Let's create a new function called `scoldUser()` inside
`functions.ts` that yells at a user if they do something they're not supposed to do:

```ts
/**
 * @readonly
 */
export function scoldUser(userId: string) {
  return `DON'T DO THAT, ${userId}!`;
}
```

This will trigger a rebuild of our connector and our new function will instantly be available in our API. We can test it
by running the following query:

```graphql
query ScoldUserQuery {
  app_ScoldUser(userId: "7cf0a66c-65b7-11ed-b904-fb49f034fbbb")
}
```

## Step 4: Import a package

The TypeScript connector acts like any NodeJS project; this means you can use all the packages you're already familiar
with. Let's add the `pg` package so we can directly interact with our database.

In an available terminal tab, run the following from the root of the project:

```bash
cd ./app/app_functions/connector
```

Then, let's install the `pg` package and its types:

```bash
npm i pg
npm i --save-dev @types/pg
```

Update your `functions.ts` file to read as follows:

```ts
import { Client } from "pg";

/**
 * @readonly Exposes the function as an NDC function (the function should only query data without making modifications)
 */
export function hello(name?: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name ?? "World"}! ðŸ‘‹`;
}

/**
 * @readonly
 */
export async function scoldUser(userId: string) {
  // Yes, for ease we're reusing the same sample app ðŸ˜‰
  const client = new Client({
    host: "35.236.11.122",
    port: 5432,
    database: "v3-docs-sample-app",
    user: "read_only_user",
    password: "readonlyuser",
  });

  await client.connect();

  const queryText = "SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = $1";
  const result = await client.query(queryText, [userId]);

  if (result.rows.length > 0) {
    const userName = result.rows[0].name;
    return `DON'T DO THAT, ${userName.toUpperCase()}!`;
  } else {
    return `Issue retrieving user`;
  }
}
```

We'll use this to determine who our user is and scold them by name.

After modifying the `functions.ts` file, re-run the same query in your API and you should see the following returned:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "app_ScoldUser": "DON'T DO THAT, SEAN!"
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Create a relationship from a command to a model

It would be nice to call this function as part of a larger query for a user. We can create relationships **directly**
between our commands and models. That means we can call `ScoldUser` directly on Sean from our API without requiring
additional queries, and â€” if we'd like â€” can even return other related data.

Find the `Users.hml` file in `/app_connector/models` and add a new entry at the bottom of the file by adding `---` and
hitting `ENTER`.

Once you hit enter, you should see Hasura's LSP kick in and provide you with the variety of options of new metadata
objects you can add. If you start typing `relationship`, choose the `Relationship (to command)` option, and hit `ENTER`,
the LSP will scaffold out your metadata object.

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/addRelationship.gif" alt="Add a relationship with LSP" width="1000px" />

You can tab through each key-value pair; the LSP will assist you by returning available options based on your data
sources. Your final relationship should look like this:

```yaml
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: scold_user
  source: Users
  target:
    command:
      name: ScoldUser
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: id
      target:
        argument:
          argumentName: userId
```

Upon saving the file, your API will be re-built. If you head to your project's console and run the following query, you
can directly call your TypeScript function from your API based on your user's ID:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  app_users(where: { id: { _eq: "7cf0a66c-65b7-11ed-b904-fb49f034fbbb" } }) {
    scold_user
  }
}
```

And the response is:

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "app_users": [
      {
        "app_scold_user": "DON'T DO THAT, SEAN!"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Add permissions

Of course, we don't want _any_ user accessing this command from the API. Just as we did earlier with the `users` model,
with commands we can also declaratively restrict access to specific roles using permissions.

Find the `ScoldUser.hml` file in `/app/app_functions/commands` and let's use the LSP to help us create a permission.
Within this file, you'll see `CommandPermissions` for `ScoldUser` command. There's already a permissions array with the
role of `admin` enabled by default.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_vs-code_existing-user-permissions.png"
  alt="Default command permissions"
  width="1000px"
/>

Let's add a new item to the array for a `user` role and disallow execution:

```yaml
---
kind: CommandPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  commandName: ScoldUser
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      allowExecution: true
    # highlight-start
    - role: user
      allowExecution: false
    # highlight-end
```

If you head back to your API, you can use the following key-value pair from earlier:

| Key             | Value  |
| --------------- | ------ |
| `x-hasura-role` | `user` |

This header tells your API that the request is being made by someone with the role of `user`. That role's access-control
rules are then evaluated against your metadata resulting in whether or not that role has access to the requested
resource.

## What just happened?

We learned a lot!

### Custom business logic

First, we introduced you to a quick and easy way of adding [custom business logic](/connectors/typescript.mdx) to your
API. As we learned on the previous page, Hasura can host your TypeScript connector for you, or you can host it yourself.

### Familiarity of Node.js

We saw that as this connector uses Node.js under the hood, we can utilize any existing `npm` package for working with
and enriching data before returning it to our end users.

### Easy authoring

Finally, we learned that with the **superpower** of LSP-assisted metadata authoring, we can intuitively and
declaratively create [relationships](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx) and
[permissions](supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx) to use these functions in concert with models present in our
**supergraph** ðŸ¤¯

For our final step in this getting started guide, let's add a second subgraph with a data source to truly make this a
supergraph.
