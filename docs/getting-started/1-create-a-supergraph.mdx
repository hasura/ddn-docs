# Create a Supergraph

## Introduction

To start, we'll walk you through the steps to create a new Hasura project, connect a database, execute your first query
and create lightning-fast production builds — all with the **new Hasura CLI**. Throughout this guide, you'll be
introduced to new Hasura concepts, like builds, our new metadata structure, and more.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

1. Install the [new Hasura CLI](/cli/installation.mdx)
2. Install the [Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura)
3. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
4. Have a PostgreSQL database

You can connect a local PostgreSQL database to Hasura DDN using the new [Hasura CLI](/cli/overview.mdx). If you don't
have a PostgreSQL database and prefer to connect to a cloud provider, check out our friends at
[Neon](https://neon.tech).

:::info Don't want to set up a database?

We've provisioned a few read-only databases for you to use for this guide if you'd like. You can use one of the
following connection strings in Step 3:

```text
postgresql://read_only_user:readonlyuser@35.236.11.122:5432/v3-docs-sample-app
```

```text
postgresql://read_only_user:readonlyuser@35.236.11.122:5432/AdventureWorks
```

```text
postgresql://read_only_user:readonlyuser@35.236.11.122:5432/Chinook
```

Throughout this guide we will be using `v3-docs-sample-app` as an example.

:::info I don't use VS Code

Good news! LSP support is coming soon to other editors. In the meantime, give
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) a try — it's a great editor!

:::

## Step 2: Login to Hasura

After our prerequisites are taken care of, login to Hasura Cloud with the CLI:

```bash
ddn login
```

This will open up a browser window and initiate an OAuth2 login flow. If the browser window doesn't open automatically,
use the link shown in the terminal output to launch the flow.

:::info New CLI?!

Yep! If you can't tell already, we've completely rewritten the CLI from the ground up. You can learn more about the new
commands by running:

```bash
ddn --help
```

:::

## Step 3: Create a new project

We'll use the `quickstart` command to create a new project. This will quickly walk us through all the necessary steps to
create our API:

```bash
ddn quickstart
```

### Step 3.1: Choose a host

We'll be prompted to choose the data delivery network to which we want to host our project:

```bash
? Choose the DDN to create your project on  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
# highlight-start
> Hasura DDN
# highlight-end
  Custom DDN
```

We'll choose `Hasura DDN` as we want Hasura to host this project for us.

### Step 3.2: Choose a directory

Next, we'll be prompted to choose the directory to house this project; let's call it `my-first-supergraph`:

```bash
? Choose the DDN to create your project on Hasura DDN
# highlight-start
? Enter the path where you want to create the Hasura project directory (./) my-first-supergraph
# highlight-end
```

The CLI will then return information about our newly-created project and where the local files are stored:

```bash
INF Creating project: ddn create project --dir my-first-supergraph
INF Project <PROJECT_NAME> is created at /<CURRENT_PATH>/my-first-supergraph
```

### Step 3.3: Connect a data source

The CLI will next ask us if we want to connect a data source. Type `y` and then choose `hasura/postgres` from the
provided options:

```bash
? We have the following data connectors available. Choose one as per your data source:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
# highlight-start
> hasura/postgres:v0.4.1
# highlight-end
  hasura/sendgrid:v0.5.0
  hasura/turso:v0.0.1
```

The CLI will add the PostgreSQL connector configuration to our project; we'll use the default name of `app_connector`,
so we can simply press `ENTER` to bring up the next prompt. Once the connector is added, the CLI will ask us for the
connection URI. If you have your own, you can provide it. Otherwise, we'll use the demo database's URI:

```
postgresql://read_only_user:readonlyuser@35.236.11.122:5432/v3-docs-sample-app
```

:::info Want to use a local DB?

You can create a [Secure Connect tunnel](/ci-cd/tunnels.mdx) to connect to a locally running PostgreSQL instance.

:::

The CLI will update the `.local.yaml` file in the project's directory with our connection string and let us know if our
connector has been set up successfully:

```bash
INF Setting env vars
INF env file .local.yaml updated
INF Data connector app_connector set up successfully
```

### Step 3.4: Track tables and relationships

When we enter our connection string, the CLI will introspect our data source and ask us if we'd like to track all of our
tables and relationships; we'll select `y` as this will automatically write our metadata for us! 🎉

```bash
TODO...NOT YET READY VIA CLI — IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING ALONG FOR TESTING, TRACK THINGS VIA THE VS CODE EXTENSION
```

At this point, the CLI will ask us if we want to connect another data source. For now, we don't, so type `n` and hit
`ENTER`.

### Step 3.5: Add the TypeScript Connector

We won't use this until later in the guide, but we can go ahead and add the NodeJS/TypeScript connector to incorporate
our own custom business logic into our API. When prompted, type `y` and hit `ENTER`. Then, let's name this connector
`ts_connector`:

```bash
? Do you want add custom business logic using NodeJS/TypeScript functions? y
? What do you want to name your hasura/nodejs:v1.0.0 connector? (app_connector) ts_connector
```

:::info Ensure Docker is running

We'll utilize a local development workflow to iteratively test our TypeScript connector and update our project's
configuration; this requires the Docker daemon running in the background. Before proceeding, ensure the daemon is up.

:::

Finally, the CLI will configure our TypeScript connector and let us know we're ready to go!

```bash
INF Adding connector manifest: ddn add connector-manifest ts_connector --type local --hub hasura/nodejs:v1.0.0 --subgraph app
INF Setting env vars
INF env file .local.yaml updated
INF Data connector ts_connector set up successfully
INF Your DDN project is all set up
INF Run 'cd my-first-supergraph && ddn dev' to build your GraphQL API.
```

## Step 4: Build your GraphQL API

If we run the provided command from the previous step, we'll see the CLI output information our first build 🎉

```bash
TODO...ERROR WHEN GENERATING A BUILD
```

## What just happened?

When you ran the `quickstart` command, the CLI created a new project for you on Hasura DDN. It also scaffolded out all
the necessary configuration and metadata in your project's directory:

```text
├── app
├── base.supergraph.hml
├── hasura.yaml
└── supergraph
```

You can learn more about this project structure by visiting our [CI/CD section](/ci-cd/overview.mdx).

But, for now, let's keep moving and add some custom business logic to our API!
