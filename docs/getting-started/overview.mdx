# Getting Started

## Introduction

Let's build an API.

In this guide we'll walk through combining multiple data sources into a single, high-performance API using Hasura DDN.

If you're new here, you're likely going to be introduced to new terminology, tools and concepts in the next few pages.
Don't worry, they will quickly become second nature to you. Let's do a quick summary here to get you started.

:::info Hasura DDN

Hasura DDN defines an entire API in a metadata format which conforms to the
[Open Data Domain Specification](https://github.com/hasura/open-data-domain-specification), (Open DD Spec).

The collection of these metadata objects together is known as a [supergraph](/glossary.mdx#supergraph) and is separated
into logical, self-contained sections called [subgraphs](/glossary.mdx#subgraphs).

A valid supergraph is compiled, or built, into an immutable API, which is run by the
[Hasura Engine](/glossary.mdx#immutable-build-runtime-system) and can be hosted on
[Hasura DDN](/glossary.mdx#hasura-data-delivery-network-ddn) (Data Delivery Network).

Within subgraphs, [data connectors](/glossary.mdx#native-data-connectors) are configured to facilitate the connection
and communication with any kind of data source, (databases, APIs, business logic functions, etc...). Data Connectors are
separate, decoupled, standalone pieces of software from the Hasura Engine and are authored by Hasura, the community or
your can build your own.

Subgraphs also contain configuration for [data types](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx),
[data models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx), [commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) (think functions) data
access [permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx), and [relationships](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx)
across data.

Subgraphs have their own development lifecycle and allow different teams to work on different parts of the supergraph at
the same time without stepping on each other's toes.

Hasura DDN includes the [Hasura CLI](/cli/overview.mdx), which is used to create and manage all aspects of your project
as well as a plugin for IDEs which help you author and validate your metadata objects.
