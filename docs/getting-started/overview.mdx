# Getting Started

## Introduction

Hasura combines multiple data sources and logic into a single, inter-related and high-performance GraphQL API.

The entire API is defined in metadata with a YAML-like syntax.

The collection of these metadata objects together is known as a [supergraph](/glossary.mdx#supergraph) and is separated
into logical, self-contained sections called [subgraphs](/glossary.mdx#subgraphs).

A valid supergraph is compiled into an immutable [build](/project-configuration/builds), which powers the resultant API.
The API build is run by the [Hasura Engine](/glossary.mdx#immutable-build-runtime-system) and can be hosted on the
[Hasura DDN](/glossary.mdx#hasura-data-delivery-network-ddn) (Data Delivery Network).

Within subgraphs, [data connectors](/glossary.mdx#native-data-connectors) are configured to facilitate the connection
and communication with any kind of data source, (databases, APIs, business logic functions, etc.). Data connectors are
separate, decoupled, standalone pieces of software from the Hasura Engine and are authored by Hasura, the community, or
you can [build your own](/connectors/build-your-own/index.mdx).

Subgraphs contain configuration for all aspects of their functioning, including
[data types](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx), [data models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx),
[commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) (think functions) data access
[permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx), [relationships](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx) across
data, and configuration for the supergraph itself.

Subgraphs can correspond to distinct data sources, or to a specific data domain. They have their own development
lifecycle and allow different teams to work on different parts of the supergraph at the same time without stepping on
each other's toes.

Hasura DDN includes the [Hasura CLI](/cli/overview.mdx), which is used to create and manage all aspects of your project
as well as a [plugin for IDEs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) which help you
author and validate your metadata objects.

Hasura DDN also includes a [Console](https://console.hasura.io/) for querying the API as well as a visual explorer for
browsing the supergraph, it's subgraphs and the data sources which connect to them. On the Console you're also able to
track and trace the performance of your API.

## Next steps

We recommend you start by [exploring a finished API](/getting-started/explore/index.mdx). However, if you're eager to
jump into it, you can start by creating your very own supergraph [here](/getting-started/build/index.mdx).
