# Getting Started

## Introduction

Hasura combines multiple data sources and logic into a single, inter-related and high-performance GraphQL API.

The entire API is defined in metadata with a YAML extension called Hasura Metadata Language (HML).

## Supergraphs and subgraphs

The collection of these metadata objects together is known as a [supergraph](/support/glossary.mdx#supergraph) and is
separated into logical, self-contained sections called [subgraphs](/support/glossary.mdx#subgraphs).

## Immutable builds and the Hasura Engine

A valid supergraph is compiled into an immutable [build](/project-configuration/builds), which powers the resultant API.
The API build is run by the [Hasura Engine](/support/glossary.mdx#immutable-build-runtime-system) and can be hosted on
the [Hasura DDN](/support/glossary.mdx#hasura-data-delivery-network-ddn) (Data Delivery Network).

## Configuring data connectors

Within subgraphs, [data connectors](/support/glossary.mdx#native-data-connectors) are configured to facilitate the
connection and communication with any kind of data source, (databases, APIs, business logic functions, etc.). Data
connectors are separate, decoupled, standalone pieces of software from the Hasura Engine and are authored by Hasura, the
community, or you can [build your own](/connectors/build-your-own/index.mdx).

## Configuring subgraphs

Subgraphs contain configuration for all aspects of their functioning, including
[data types](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx), [data models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx),
[commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) (think functions) data access
[permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx), [relationships](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx) across
data, and configuration for the supergraph itself.

## Development lifecycle for subgraphs

Subgraphs can correspond to distinct data sources, or to a specific data domain. They have their own development
lifecycle and allow different teams to work on different parts of the supergraph at the same time without stepping on
each others' toes.

## Tools for authoring, managing, and exploring your API

Hasura DDN includes the [Hasura CLI](/cli/overview.mdx), which is used to create and manage all aspects of your project
as well as a [plugin for IDEs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) which help you
author and validate your metadata objects.

Hasura DDN also includes a [console](https://console.hasura.io/) — our GUI — for querying the API as well as a visual
explorer for browsing the supergraph, it's subgraphs and the data sources which connect to them. On the console you're
also able to track and trace the performance of your API.

## Next steps

You can start by [exploring a finished API](/getting-started/explore/index.mdx).

Or, create a supergraph now by following the [quickstart here](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx).
