        Getting started with Hasura DDN is quick and straightforward. In just a few steps, you can connect your data
        sources, define your API, and begin building your data supergraph. Hasura's powerful tools, like the CLI and
        console, make it easy to create and manage your supergraph, all while ensuring seamless integration with your
        data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're using a sample project or your own data, you'll be up and running in no time. Hasuraâ€™s intuitive
        setup process lets you focus on building, not on configuring, so you can quickly ship the next great update to
        your product.
