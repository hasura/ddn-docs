# Getting Started

## Introduction

Let's build an API.

In this guide we'll walk through using Hasura DDN.

If you're new here, you're likely going to be introduced to new terminology, tools and concepts in the next few pages.
Don't worry, they will quickly become second nature to you.

:::info Notes on the getting started section

In the next pages, we'll guide you through the process of building an API **locally** and thereafter, deploy it to
Hasura DDN cloud.

You'll also notice the frequent use of verbose, explicit CLI commands throughout this section. This is by design.
The DDN CLI is crafted to perform tasks atomically, enabling you to achieve specific outcomes efficiently while
enabling further convenience and automation in later versions, and for users to add it for themselves.

**We also recommend that you use your own data sources to effectively grok the concepts we're covering.** However, when
connecting a data source, we'll share some sample connection strings with you.

## Hasura In a nutshell

Hasura combines multiple data sources and logic into a single, inter-related and high-performance API.

The entire API is defined in metadata with a YAML-like syntax.

The collection of these metadata objects together is known as a [supergraph](/glossary.mdx#supergraph) and is separated
into logical, self-contained sections called [subgraphs](/glossary.mdx#subgraphs).

A valid supergraph is compiled into an immutable build, which powers the resultant API. In turn, the API build is run by
the [Hasura Engine](/glossary.mdx#immutable-build-runtime-system) and can be hosted on
[Hasura DDN](/glossary.mdx#hasura-data-delivery-network-ddn) (Data Delivery Network).

Within subgraphs, [data connectors](/glossary.mdx#native-data-connectors) are configured to facilitate the connection
and communication with any kind of data source, (databases, APIs, business logic functions, etc.). Data connectors are
separate, decoupled, standalone pieces of software from the Hasura Engine and are authored by Hasura, the community, or
you can build your own.

Subgraphs contain configuration for all aspects of their functioning, including
[data types](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx), [data models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx),
[commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) (think functions) data access
[permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx), and [relationships](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx) across
data.

Subgraphs can correspond to distinct data sources, or to a specific data domain. They have their own development
lifecycle and allow different teams to work on different parts of the supergraph at the same time without stepping on
each other's toes.

Hasura DDN includes the [Hasura CLI](/cli/overview.mdx), which is used to create and manage all aspects of your project
as well as a plugin for IDEs which help you author and validate your metadata objects.

Hasura DDN also includes a Console for querying the API as well as a visual explorer for browsing the supergraph, it's
subgraphs and the data sources which connect to them. On the Console you're also able to track and trace the performance
of your API.
