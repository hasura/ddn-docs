        In this section, we'll get you up and running with your first secure, globally-scalable, GraphQL API deployed on
        Hasura DDN ðŸŽ‰
      </p>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Below, we'll break down some key concepts and terms before you dive in and start building. If you'd like a
        high-level overview, check out this page on the <a href="/basics/core-concepts">core concepts</a> of DDN. On
        this page, we'll cover constructs such as <b>supergraphs</b>, <b>subgraphs</b>, <b>types</b>, <b>models</b>,{" "}
        <b>commands</b>, <b>permissions</b>, and <b>relationships</b>. These are the fundamental building blocks of your
        DDN API.
      </p>
      <h3>Supergraph</h3>
      <p>
        Each Hasura project contains a single <b>supergraph</b>. A supergraph is an entity that acts as a graph,
        composed of different data sources that â€” when built â€” is served over a single API. When you create a new Hasura
        project, your supergraph is automatically created.
      </p>
      <h3>Subgraphs</h3>
      <p>
        In turn, your supergraph is composed of one or many <b>subgraphs</b>. It's helpful to think of subgraphs in
        terms of business domains within your organization. For example, a <code>ux</code> subgraph may be created for a
        User Experience team which owns a relational database <i>and</i> a microservice composed of many TypeScript
        functions responsible for custom business logic. This means that a single subgraph can have <i>multiple</i> data
        sources.
      </p>
      <h3>Models and commands</h3>
      <p>
        Your data sources are described by <b>models</b> and <b>commands</b> that represent the different collections
        present in the source. For a relational database, these are things like tables and views. For a microservice,
        this could be each function.
      </p>
      <h3>Relationships and access-control</h3>
      <p>
        You can create rich, deeply-integrated APIs using <b>relationships</b> within and across subgraphs using a
        simple, declarative syntax. Further, you can limit who can access different models and commands by using the
        same syntax to quickly and easily define <b>permissions</b> for your users.
      </p>
      <h3>Types</h3>
      <p>
        All of this is constructed using <b>types</b>, which can be primitives or defined by you as the architect of the
        API.
