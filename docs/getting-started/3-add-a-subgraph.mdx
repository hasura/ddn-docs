# Add another Subgraph

## Introduction

Our supergraph wouldn't be much of a supergraph with only a single subgraph. As we said in
[the overview](/getting-started/overview), you can organize subgraphs around data domains within your organization.
Ideally, the team responsible for a set of data sources **owns** a subgraph and is responsible for authoring and
maintaining it.

## Step 1: Stop dev mode

Before we add the subgraph, we'll first need to stop `dev` mode in the CLI. In the terminal tab in which this is
running, press `CTRL+C`.

## Step 2: Add the new subgraph

Using the same tab, we'll add a second subgraph using the following command:

```bash
ddn create subgraph chinook
```

The CLI should respond that the subgraph was successfully created.

Since this is a PostgreSQL database, we can add a connector manifest using the following CLI command:

```bash
ddn add connector-manifest chinook_connector --subgraph connector --hub-connector hasura/postgres:v0.5.0 --type cloud
```
