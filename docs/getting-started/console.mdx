# Quickstart from the Console

## Introduction

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create a new Hasura project, connect a database, execute your first
query, and create lightning-fast production builds â€” all using the **Hasura Console**, our GUI. Throughout this guide,
you'll be introduced to new Hasura concepts, like builds, our new metadata structure, and more.

:::tip Prerequisites

A PostgreSQL database

If you're looking for a fast and easy way to get started with a PostgreSQL database, check out our friends at
[Neon](https://neon.tech).

## Step 1: Log into Hasura

Go to the [Hasura Console](https://console.hasura.io) and sign into your account:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-login.png" alt="Log into Hasura Console" width="1000px" />

## Step 2: Create a new project

Click on the `Create ->` button to create a new project:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-create-project.png" alt="Create new project" width="1000px" />

Upon your project's successful creation, you'll be brought to its GraphiQL Explorer. You'll notice that there are no
types available in your GraphQL API. That will soon change!

## Step 3: Connect a data source

Head to your project's metadata by clicking on the `Metadata` tab on the left. We'll begin by connecting to a data
source via the `+ Connect` button:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-connect-data-source.png"
  alt="Click to connect data source"
  width="1000px"
/>

Enter a name for your data source, and select the `Postgres` option. At the bottom of the modal, enter your connection
string and then click `Connect`:

:::info All those tables!

If your database has tables present, Hasura automatically detected all of them and added them to your project's metadata
ðŸŽ‰

:::

## Step 4: Scaffold your metadata

Now that we've connected to a data source, we can import **models** from it to our metadata. Click on the `+ Import`
button next to `Models` to begin:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-add-models.png" alt="Click + Import for Models" width="1000px" />

We'll then choose our data source, check the box for all of the tables we want to import, and click `Import`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-check-all-import.png" alt="Add models" width="1000px" />

While we're here, check out the `Relationships` section of your metadata file. Hasura automatically detected the
relationships between your tables. You can add them by clicking the `+ Import` button:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-show-relationships.png"
  alt="Show relationships in metadata view"
  width="1000px"
/>

You can even keep scrolling and see the newly-generated `Types` and `GraphQL Interface` sections of your metadata file.

:::info What are models?

This is the first new concept we've introduced in this guide. Models are a new way to represent your data in Hasura.

Models in the [OpenDD Spec](/data-domain-modeling/overview.mdx) refer to a collection of objects (such as rows in a
relational database, or documents in a NoSQL database) of a given OpenDD Spec type. Models are backed by a data source
and can support CRUD operations. You can learn more about models [here](/data-domain-modeling/models.mdx).

:::

## Step 5: Create a new build

Now that we've connected to a data source and imported our models, we're ready to create a new **build**. Click on the
`+ Create New Build` button in the top-right corner of the Console:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_create-new-build.png" alt="Create a new build" width="1000px" />

You can even add a short description so you and your teammates know what this build modifies.

:::info What's a build?

Builds are a new concept in Hasura that allow you to quickly iterate and prototype on your project's metadata. A build
is an immutable, fully-functioning GraphQL API that represents a milestone in your development cycle.

It may be helpful to think of builds as git commits. Since each is deployed on Hasura Cloud, it can be shared with other
users.

Each build is completely independent. One project can have multiple builds, out of which, one is applied to production.
This workflow allows for easier rollbacks on production, and greater collaboration during development.

:::

## Step 6: Run your first query

Assuming you have some tables and data in your database, you can now run your first query! Click on the `GraphiQL`
button in the left-hand sidenav of the Console.

We're using the docs sample app's schema for this guide's visuals, but you can use the GraphiQL Explorer to create your
query or write it manually:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-execute-query-on-build.png" alt="Execute a query" width="1000px" />

## Step 7: Apply your build

After you're satisfied your API is behaving as expected, click the `build_id` in the top navigation bar. This will bring
up all your project's builds and allow you to choose one to apply. Click the `Apply` button to apply your build:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-apply-build.png" alt="Apply a build" width="1000px" />

:::info What does it mean to apply a build?

Applying a build means that it's being promoted to your project's production endpoint. **This is a new concept in Hasura
which allows you to quickly iterate â€” and, if needed, roll back â€” your project's metadata to all of your users,
worldwide.**

:::

## Step 8: Query your production endpoint

At the top of the Console, you'll see a toggle that allows you to switch between your project's API and your project's
currently selected preview build. Toggle to your project's applied build:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.1.1_console-view-project-graphiql.png" alt="Toggle production" width="1000px" />

You can now execute a query against this endpoint.

## What's next?

### Iterate on your metadata

We've just demonstrated how to quickly get set up and running with Hasura. Now that you've got a project up and running,
you can iterate on your metadata and build out your API. Head back to the Metadata tab, make some modifications, create
a new build, and see what happens ðŸŽ‰
