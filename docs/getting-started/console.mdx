# Quickstart with Console

## Introduction

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create a new Hasura project, connect a database, execute your first
query, and create lightning-fast production builds — all using the **Hasura Console**, our GUI. Throughout this guide,
you'll be introduced to new Hasura concepts, like builds, our new metadata structure, and more.

:::tip Prerequisites

A PostgreSQL database

You can connect a local PostgreSQL database to Hasura DDN using the new [Hasura CLI](/cli/overview.mdx). If you don't
have a PostgreSQL database and prefer to connect to a cloud provider, check out our friends at
[Neon](https://neon.tech).

:::

:::info Don't want to set up a database?

We've provisioned a read-only database for you to use for this guide if you'd like. You can use the following connection
string in Step 3:

```text
postgresql://read_only:kd4555jkfjfkdj39f8f8d9d@35.236.11.122:5432/v3-docs-sample-app
```

:::

## Step 1: Log into Hasura

Go to the [Hasura Console](https://console.hasura.io) and sign in to your account:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-login.png" alt="Log into Hasura Console" width="1000px" />

## Step 2: Create a new project

Click the `+ New Project` button to create a new project:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-create-project.png" alt="Create new project" width="1000px" />

## Step 3: Connect a data source

Enter `default` for the name of the connection and enter the connection string for your database. Then, click
`Connect data source`.

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-add-connection-string.png" alt="Empty explorer" width="1000px" />

<Tabs groupId="db-location" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="hosted" label="Hosted Database">

If your database is hosted on a cloud provider, you can connect to it by copying your connection string which should
look like this:

```text
postgresql://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE_NAME>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Local Database">

If you want to connect a local database for development, you can use the new [Hasura CLI](/cli/overview.mdx) to create a
local daemon and securely connect to your database.

### Step 3.1: Start your database

Start your local database. For example, if you are using Docker, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name <CONTAINER_NAME> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASSWORD> -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

### Step 3.2: Start the daemon

Start the Hasura daemon with the `daemon start` command:

```bash
hasura3 daemon start
```

The daemon will block this window while it runs.

### Step 3.3: Create a Secure Connect tunnel

Open a new tab or window for your terminal and run the `create` command:

```bash
hasura3 tunnel create <SOCKET>
```

The `<SOCKET>` argument is the address of your local database. For example, if you are running a local PostgreSQL
database on the default port, you would use `localhost:5432`.

The CLI will return a URL that you can use to connect to your database. You should use this URL to form a connection
string for your database, like this:

```text
postgresql://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<URL_RETURNED_BY_THE_CLI>/<DATABASE_NAME>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When you click `Connect data source`, Hasura will automatically create your GraphQL API and build your metadata:

:::info What's happening under the hood?

Hasura first introspects your data source and identifies **models** that can be created according to the
[OpenDD Spec](/data-domain-modeling/overview.mdx).

Models are a new way to represent your data in Hasura and refer to a collection of objects (such as rows in a relational
database, or documents in a NoSQL database) of a given OpenDD Spec type. Models are backed by a data source and can
support CRUD operations. You can learn more about models [here](/data-domain-modeling/models.mdx).

Next, Hasura will determine which **relationships** can be created between your models. Relationships allow for nested
queries, and are based on foreign-key constraints in your database. You can learn more about relationships
[here](/data-domain-modeling/relationships.mdx).

Finally, a **build** is created and applied to your project's default environment. Builds are a new concept in Hasura
that allow you to quickly iterate and prototype on your project's metadata. A build is an immutable, fully-functioning
GraphQL API that represents a milestone in your development cycle. See the [builds lifecycle](/ci-cd/builds.mdx) section
for more information.

It may be helpful to think of builds as git commits. Since each is deployed on Hasura Cloud, it can be shared with other
users.

Each build is completely independent. One project can have multiple builds, out of which, one is applied to your
project's GraphQL endpoint. This workflow allows for easier rollbacks on production, and greater collaboration during
development. Further, when working with your applied build, you can quickly deploy — and, if needed, roll back — your
project's metadata to all of your users, worldwide.

## Step 4: Run your first query

Assuming you have some tables and data in your database, you can now run your first query! Click on the `GraphiQL`
button in the left-hand sidenav of the Console.

We're using the docs sample app's schema for this guide's visuals, but you can use the GraphiQL Explorer to create your
query or write it manually:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-execute-query-on-build.png" alt="Execute a query" width="1000px" />

<details>
<summary>Using our sample db? You can use this query!</summary>

```graphql
query OrdersQuery {
  orders {
    id
    status
    delivery_date
    user {
      id
      name
      email
    }
    product {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Step 5: Query your production endpoint

At the top of the Console, you'll see a toggle that allows you to switch between your project's API and your project's
currently selected preview build. Toggle to your project's applied build:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.1.1_console-view-project-graphiql.png" alt="Toggle production" width="1000px" />

You can now execute a query against this endpoint.

## Step 6: Explore your API

Now that you've got a project up and running, you can explore your API using the Explorer on the left-hand sidenav.
Below, we see a visualization of our data source as a **subgraph**. This can be combined with other subgraphs to create
a **supergraph**.

## What's next?

### Iterate on your metadata

We've just demonstrated how to quickly get set up and running with Hasura. Now that you've got a project, you can
iterate on your metadata and build out your API.

We encourage you to check out the [local development workflow](/getting-started/local-dev.mdx) which allows you to work
on your project's metadata locally and deploy it to Hasura Cloud when you're ready.

Learn more about structuring your data supergraph by checking out our
[Data Domain Modeling](/data-domain-modeling/overview.mdx) section.
