# Quickstart from the Console

## Introduction

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create a new Hasura project, connect a database, execute your first
query, and create lightning-fast production builds â€” all using the **Hasura Console**, our GUI. Throughout this guide,
you'll be introduced to new Hasura concepts, like builds, our new metadata structure, and more.

:::tip Prerequisites

A PostgreSQL database

You can connect a local PostgreSQL database to Hasura DDN using the new [Hasura CLI](/cli/overview.mdx). If you don't
have a PostgreSQL database and prefer to connect to a cloud provider, check out our friends at
[Neon](https://neon.tech).

:::

## Step 1: Log into Hasura

Go to the [Hasura Console](https://console.hasura.io) and sign into your account:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-login.png" alt="Log into Hasura Console" width="1000px" />

## Step 2: Create a new project

Click on the `Create ->` button to create a new project:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-create-project.png" alt="Create new project" width="1000px" />

Upon your project's successful creation, you'll be brought to the metadata Explorer.

## Step 3: Connect a data source

You'll see the steps available, starting with connecting a data source. Click this button:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console_empty_explorer.png" alt="Empty explorer" width="1000px" />

<Tabs groupId="db-location" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="hosted" label="Hosted Database">

If your database is hosted on a cloud provider, you can connect to it by copying your connection string which should
look like this:

```text
postgresql://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE_NAME>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Local Database">

If you want to connect a local database for development, you can use the new [Hasura CLI](/cli/overview.mdx) to create a
local daemon and securely connect to your database.

### Step 3.1: Start your database

Start your local database. For example, if you are using Docker, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name <CONTAINER_NAME> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASSWORD> -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

### Step 3.2: Start the daemon

Start the Hasura daemon with the `daemon start` command:

```bash
hasura3 local daemon start
```

The daemon will block this window while it runs.

### Step 3.3: Create a Secure Connect tunnel

Open a new tab or window for your terminal and run the `create` command:

```bash
hasura3 cloud tunnel create <SOCKET>
```

The `<SOCKET>` argument is the address of your local database. For example, if you are running a local PostgreSQL
database on the default port, you would use `localhost:5432`.

The CLI will return a URL that you can use to connect to your database. You should use this URL to form a connection
string for your database, like this:

```text
postgresql://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<URL_RETURNED_BY_THE_CLI>/<DATABASE_NAME>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Enter a name for your data source and, at the bottom of the modal, enter your connection string and then click
`Connect`:

## Step 4: Scaffold your metadata

Now that we've connected to a data source, we can import **models** from it to our metadata. After clicking the `import`
button, we'll then choose our data source, check the box for all of the tables we want to import, and click `Import`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-check-all-import.png" alt="Add models" width="1000px" />

:::info What are models?

This is the first new concept we've introduced in this guide. Models are a new way to represent your data in Hasura.

Models in the [OpenDD Spec](/data-domain-modeling/overview.mdx) refer to a collection of objects (such as rows in a
relational database, or documents in a NoSQL database) of a given OpenDD Spec type. Models are backed by a data source
and can support CRUD operations. You can learn more about models [here](/data-domain-modeling/models.mdx).

:::

The onboarding guide will suggest next to create a build. However, let's import some relationships by clicking
`+ Import` in the top-left corner and then selecting `Import Relationships`.

<Thumbnail

  alt="Show relationships in metadata view"
  width="1000px"
/>

Hasura automatically detected the relationships between your tables. You can add them by clicking the `+ Import` button:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Show relationships in metadata view"
  width="1000px"
/>

## Step 5: Create a new build

Now that we've connected to a data source and imported our models, we're ready to create a new **build**. Click on the
`+ Create New Build` button in the top-right corner of the Console:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_create-new-build.png" alt="Create a new build" width="1000px" />

You can even add a short description so you and your teammates know what this build modifies.

:::info What's a build?

Builds are a new concept in Hasura that allow you to quickly iterate and prototype on your project's metadata. A build
is an immutable, fully-functioning GraphQL API that represents a milestone in your development cycle.

It may be helpful to think of builds as git commits. Since each is deployed on Hasura Cloud, it can be shared with other
users.

Each build is completely independent. One project can have multiple builds, out of which, one is applied to production.
This workflow allows for easier rollbacks on production, and greater collaboration during development.

:::

## Step 6: Run your first query

Assuming you have some tables and data in your database, you can now run your first query! Click on the `GraphiQL`
button in the left-hand sidenav of the Console.

We're using the docs sample app's schema for this guide's visuals, but you can use the GraphiQL Explorer to create your
query or write it manually:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-execute-query-on-build.png" alt="Execute a query" width="1000px" />

## Step 7: Apply your build

After you're satisfied your API is behaving as expected, click the `build_id` in the top navigation bar. This will bring
up all your project's builds and allow you to choose one to apply. Click the `Apply` button to apply your build:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-apply-build.png" alt="Apply a build" width="1000px" />

:::info What does it mean to apply a build?

Applying a build means that it's being promoted to your project's endpoint. **This is a new concept in Hasura which
allows you to quickly iterate â€” and, if needed, roll back â€” your project's metadata to all of your users, worldwide.**

:::

## Step 8: Query your production endpoint

At the top of the Console, you'll see a toggle that allows you to switch between your project's API and your project's
currently selected preview build. Toggle to your project's applied build:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.1.1_console-view-project-graphiql.png" alt="Toggle production" width="1000px" />

You can now execute a query against this endpoint.

## What's next?

### Iterate on your metadata

We've just demonstrated how to quickly get set up and running with Hasura. Now that you've got a project up and running,
you can iterate on your metadata and build out your API. Head back to the Metadata tab, make some modifications, create
a new build, and see what happens ðŸŽ‰
