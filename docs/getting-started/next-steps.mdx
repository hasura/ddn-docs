# Next Steps

## Introduction

Congratulations! If you've made it this far, you've built your first supergraph, complete with custom business logic,
access control, and multiple connected data sources, all that can be owned by individual teams ðŸŽ‰

Don't stop there! We recommend checking out the sections below to complete your knowledge of Hasura DDN; you'll be
production-ready in no time!

## Authentication

Learn how to [utilize JWTs or webhooks](/auth/overview.mdx) to integrate your API with your existing authentication
platform.

## Connector deployment

See how you can quickly and easily [build and deploy **custom** connectors](/connectors/deployment.mdx) to Hasura or
learn how to deploy them on your own infrastructure.

You can also [write your own connectors](/connectors/build-your-own-connector.mdx) to bring any data source into your
GraphQL API.

## CI/CD

Implement best practices, take the stress off your teams, and [automate your deployments](/ci-cd/deployment.mdx) using
industry-standard CI/CD tools and the DDN CLI.

## Supergraph modeling

Architect your APIs in a simple and declarative syntax with the assistance of LSP; we believe that a solid API should be
a simple by-product of [well-modeled data](/supergraph-modeling/overview.mdx).
