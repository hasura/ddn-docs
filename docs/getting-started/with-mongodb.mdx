# Get Started with Hasura DDN and MongoDB

<Prereqs />

## Guide

In this guide, you'll learn how to get started with Hasura DDN and a MongoDB database. You'll set up a new Hasura DDN
project, connect it to a new MongoDB database, and run your first query. This guide assumes you're starting from
scratch, but you can easily follow the steps if you already have data seeded; Hasura will never modify your source
schema.

### Step 1. Create a collection in your MongoDB database

```js title="First, you'll create a new collection in your MongoDB database:"
// Create the collection and insert some data
db.createCollection("users");
db.users.insertMany([
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35 },
]);
```

:::tip Connect to cloud local data sources

Hasura DDN can connect to hosted or local data sources. If you have a cloud-hosted MongoDB provider, you can connect to
your database and seed the table with the above data. Alternatively, you can
[run MongoDB locally using Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo).

:::

### Step 2. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

### Step 3. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, you'll create a new local project. Run the following command:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

### Step 4. Initialize your MongoDB connector

```sh title="Initialize a new MongoDB connector. Run the following command:"
ddn connector init my_mongo -i
```

From the dropdown, start typing `MongoDB` and hit enter.

Set your environment variables:

| Variable               | Value                                                                                                   | Required |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `MONGODB_DATABASE_URI` | The connection string to your source in this format: `mongodb://username:password@hostname:port/dbname` | Yes      |

:::info Connecting a local database?

Hasura DDN uses a unique domain to resolve local services when using Docker. In the connection string above, you can
replace `hostname` with `local.hasura.dev` if you're connecting to a local database running inside of a Docker
container.

:::

### Step 5. Introspect your MongoDB database

```sh title="Next, you'll introspect your MongoDB database:"
ddn connector introspect my_mongo
```

### Step 6. Add your model

```sh title="Now, you'll track the collections as models in your MongoDB database:"
ddn models add my_mongo users
```

:::info Have multiple collections?

You can quickly grab them all using:

```sh
ddn models add my_mongo "*"
```

:::

### Step 7. Create a new build

```sh title="Next, you'll create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

### Step 8. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and MongoDB connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 9. Run your first query

```sh title="Open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="And, if you write a query like this:"
query {
  users {
    name
    age
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 25
      },
      {
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": 30
      },
      {
        "name": "Charlie",
        "age": 35
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a Hasura DDN project and connected it to a MongoDB database. Next, you can
explore more advanced features like [relationships](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx),
[permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx), and more.

Take a look at our [MongoDB docs](/connectors/mongodb/index.mdx) to learn more about how to use Hasura DDN with MongoDB.
