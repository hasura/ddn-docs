# Connect to Data

You can connect any kind of data to Hasura DDN.

The connection is done through a [**data connector**](/connectors/overview.mdx), a piece of software independent of
the Hasura Engine which facilitates the connection between the two using a common implementation specification.

You can use a data connector "off-the-shelf" and built by Hasura, or one built by the community, or you can build
your own.

Data connectors can be used directly via the Hasura Connector Hub using the CLI. The Connector Hub is a managed list of
connectors that you can use to connect to your data sources.

You can connect both cloud-hosted and local data sources to Hasura DDN.

Using the CLI, we will add a data connector for your data source and generate the metadata that Hasura can
understand to integrate your data source into your supergraph.
