# Connect to Data

You can connect both cloud-hosted and local PostgreSQL databases to Hasura DDN. Regardless of where your database is
hosted, it will be connected to your project using a [**data connector**](/connectors/overview.mdx). Together, with the
CLI, the PostgreSQL data connector will generate and use metadata that Hasura can understand to integrate your data
source into your project.
