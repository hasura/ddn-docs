# Connect to Data

You can connect both cloud-hosted and local data sources to Hasura DDN. Regardless of where your data source is hosted,
it will be connected to your project using a [**data connector**](/connectors/overview.mdx). Together with the CLI, the
data connector for your data source will generate and use metadata that Hasura can understand to integrate your data
source into your project.
