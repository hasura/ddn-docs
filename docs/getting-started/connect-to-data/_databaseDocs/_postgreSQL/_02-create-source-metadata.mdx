## What's about to happen?

After initializing a connector and creating a JSON configuration, which represents our tables in PostgreSQL, we can use
it to generate Hasura metadata. In the steps below, we'll utilize our `configuration.json` — populated by introspecting
our PostgreSQL database — to create metadata which Hasura can use to construct our API.

## Step 1. Create the Hasura metadata

:::tip Required

- <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/prerequisites" text="The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed" />
- A new or existing <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/init-supergraph" text="supergraph" />
- A new or existing <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/init-subgraph" text="subgraph" />
- A <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/connect-to-data/connect-a-source" text="PostgreSQL connector"/> initialized

Hasura DDN uses a concept called "connector linking" to take [NDC-compliant](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec)
configuration JSON files for a data connector and transform them into an `hml` (Hasura Metadata Language) file as a <BaseUrlLink to="/supergraph-modeling/data-connectors/" text="DataConnectorLink" /> metadata object.

Basically, metadata objects in `hml` files define our API.

First we need to create this `hml` file with the `connector-link add` command and then convert our configuration files
into `hml` syntax and add it to this file with the `connector-link update` command.

Let's name the `hml` file the same as our connector, `my_pg`:

```bash title="Run the following from the root of your project:"
ddn connector-link add my_pg \
  --subgraph my_subgraph \
  --configure-host http://local.hasura.dev:8082
```

The new file is scaffolded out at `my_subgraph/metadata/my_pg/my_pg.hml`.

<details>
  <summary>Click here for an example `hml` `DataConnectorLink` file</summary>

```yaml title="my_pg.hml"
kind: DataConnectorLink
version: v1
definition:
name: my_pg
url:
  readWriteUrls:
    read:
      valueFromEnv: MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_PG_READ_URL
    write:
      valueFromEnv: MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_PG_WRITE_URL
schema:
  version: v0.1
  schema:
    scalar_types: {}
    object_types: {}
    collections: []
    functions: []
    procedures: []
  capabilities:
    version: ''
    capabilities:
      query: {}
      mutation: {}
```

</details>

The generated file has two environment variables — one for reads and one for writes. Because we used the convenience
flag: `--configure-host` on the command, these values are already set in the `.env.my_subgraph` file:

```env title="my_subgraph/.env.my_subgraph"
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_PG_READ_URL="http://local.hasura.dev:8082"
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_PG_WRITE_URL="http://local.hasura.dev:8082"
```

These values are for the PostgreSQL connector itself and utilize `local.hasura.dev` to ensure proper resolution within
the docker container.

## Step 2. Start the services

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
Let's start our docker compose services.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat) docker compose -f docker-compose.hasura.yaml watch
```

This starts our Hasura Engine, observability tools and the MongoDB connector since we added the connector's Docker
compose file to the main `docker-compose.hasura.yaml` file using the --add-to-compose-file flag when we initialized the
connector. `HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat)` gives the Hasura Engine access to the DDN CLI's authentication token.

We can navigate to the following address, with the port modified, to see the schema of our MongoDB database:

```bash
http://localhost:8082/schema
```

## Step 3. Update the new DataConnectorLink object

Finally, now that our `DataConnectorLink` has the correct environment variables configured for the PostgreSQL connector,
we can run the update command to have the CLI look at the configuration JSON and transform it to reflect our database's
schema in `hml` format. In a new terminal tab, run:

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn connector-link update my_pg --subgraph my_subgraph
```

After this command runs, you can open your `my_subgraph/metadata/my_pg.hml` file and see your metadata completely
scaffolded out for you 🎉

## What did this do?

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
By creating a `my_pg.hml` file, we've provided Hasura with a link between our original data source and the types which
we'll eventually expose via our API.

## Next steps

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
With a data connector fully configured, you can now start to create metadata for each table and view in your PostgreSQL
database using `hml`. Learn how to do this by <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/connect-to-data/add-source-entities" text="exposing source entities" />.
