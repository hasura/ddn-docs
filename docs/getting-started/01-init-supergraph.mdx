# Create a Supergraph

## What's about to happen?

We're going to create a [**supergraph**](glossary.mdx#supergraph).

Your supergraph is the composite of all your subgraphs and their various data sources and business logic.

## Steps

### Step 1. Initialize your supergraph

To initialize your supergraph, from an empty directory, run:

```bash
ddn supergraph init --dir .
```

:::tip Specifying a directory

Instead of passing a `.` (this directory specifier) you can pass a directory name to the `--dir` flag to create a
supergraph in a specific directory. If it doesn't exist it will be created.

:::

### Step 2. Set the supergraph config

Next, as a feature of convenience, we'll set the `context` which replaces the need to set frequently used default values
(such as the flag `--supergraph`) when utilizing CLI commands by saving the path of your `supergraph.yaml` to a context
file in your `.hasura` directory. You can learn more about usign context [here](/cli/commands/ddn_context.mdx).

In the project's root directory, run:

```bash
ddn context set supergraph ./supergraph.yaml
```

### Step 3. Build your supergraph

You now have all the scaffolding necessary to start developing your Hasura supergraph. In fact, we can create a build
and by running the following command:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

### Step 4. Start the services

Then, we can start the `docker-compose.hasura.yaml` in the root of the directory to start the GraphQL engine and the
accompanying services:

```bash
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn internal print-pat) docker compose -f docker-compose.hasura.yaml watch
```

You should see your various services returned as `Running` or `Started` in the terminal. This provides a watch mode,
which will allow us to iteratively modify and test our API locally with blazing-fast feedback loops.

You can now navigate to
[`https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql?url=http://localhost:3000`](https://console.hasura.io/local/graphql?url=http://localhost:3000)
and interact with your API using the Hasura Console!

However, you'll see a very empty GraphQL schema. We're showing you this so you can see that your API starts off as a
blank slate, allowing you to iteratively and collaboratively build it out. Hasura utilizes a system of
[immutable builds](/project-configuration/builds.mdx) which provide a stable snapshot of your API at any point in the
development process.

## What did this do?

The CLI created all the files needed for local development and iteration in your local directory, including a
docker-compose for local development and helper files for VS Code.

`ddn supergraph init` will always be the first command you run when starting a new project. However, you may have
arrived here after being invited to join an existing project. In that case, your supergraph will already exist; you can
simply clone the repository containing your supergraph and pick up with the next section.

Regardless of how you've arrived at your supergraph, you'll have needed to create a build and then run it using Docker.
This is the typical workflow when starting a new project or picking up with an existing one.

## Next steps

The most common next step from here is to [add a new subgraph](/getting-started/02-init-subgraph.mdx).
