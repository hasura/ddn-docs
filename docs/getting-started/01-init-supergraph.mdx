# Create a Supergraph

We'll start our journey by initializing our [**supergraph**](/project-configuration/config.mdx#supergraph). Your
supergraph is the composite of all your subgraphs and their various data sources and business logic.

To initialize your supergraph, from an empty directory, run:

```bash
ddn supergraph init --dir .
```

:::tip Specifying a directory

Instead of passing a `.` (this directory specifier) you can pass a directory name to the `--dir` flag to create a
supergraph in a specific directory. If it doesn't exist it will be created.

## What did this do?

The CLI created all the files needed for local development and iteration in your local directory, including a
docker-compose for local development and helper files for VS Code.

You now have all the scaffolding necessary to start developing your Hasura supergraph.

`ddn supergraph init` will always be the first command you run when starting a new project. However, you may have
arrived here after being invited to join an existing project. In that case, your supergraph will already exist; you can
simply clone the repository containing your supergraph and pick up with the next section.

At this point, you could very well start the GraphQL engine via the docker-compose in your directory. However, without
any subgraphs or connected data sources, your supergraph is quite lacking. In the next section, we'll add our first
subgraph.
