# Create a Supergraph

## What's about to happen?

We're going to create a [**supergraph**](/project-configuration/config.mdx#supergraph).

Your supergraph is the composite of all your subgraphs and their various data sources and business logic.

## Steps

### Step 1. Initialize your supergraph

To initialize your supergraph, from an empty directory, run:

```bash
ddn supergraph init --dir .
```

:::tip Specifying a directory

Instead of passing a `.` (this directory specifier) you can pass a directory name to the `--dir` flag to create a
supergraph in a specific directory. If it doesn't exist it will be created.

:::

### Step 2. Set the supergraph config

Next, as a feature of convenience, we'll set the `context` which replaces the need to set frequently used default values
(such as the flag `--supergraph`) when utilizing CLI commands.

```bash
# in the project directory, run
ddn context set supergraph ./supergraph.yaml
```

## What did this do?

The CLI created all the files needed for local development and iteration in your local directory, including a
docker-compose for local development and helper files for VS Code.

```bash

├── docker-compose.hasura.yaml
├── engine
│   ├── auth_config.json
│   ├── metadata.json
│   └── open_dd.json
├── hasura.yaml
├── otel-collector-config.yaml
├── supergraph.yaml
├── supergraph_globals
│   ├── auth-config.hml
│   ├── compatibility-config.hml
│   └── graphql-config.hml
```

</details>

You now have all the scaffolding necessary to start developing your Hasura supergraph.

`ddn supergraph init` will always be the first command you run when starting a new project. However, you may have
arrived here after being invited to join an existing project. In that case, your supergraph will already exist; you can
simply clone the repository containing your supergraph and pick up with the next section.

## Next steps

At this point, you could very well start the GraphQL engine via the docker-compose in your directory. However, without
any subgraphs or connected data sources, your supergraph is quite lacking.

The most common next step from here is to [add a new subgraph](/getting-started/02-init-subgraph.mdx).
