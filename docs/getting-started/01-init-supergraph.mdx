# Create a Supergraph

We'll start our journey by initializing our [**supergraph**](/project-configuration/config.mdx#supergraph). Your
supergraph is the composite of all your subgraphs and their various data sources, including custom business logic.

To init your supergraph, from an empty directory, run:

```bash
ddn supergraph init --dir .
```

## What did this do?

The CLI created all the files needed for local development and iteration in your local directory, including a
docker-compose for local development and helper files for VS Code.

```bash
.
├── .devcontainer
│  └── devcontainer.json
├── .env.engine
├── .gitattributes
├── .vscode
│  ├── extensions.json
│  ├── launch.json
│  └── tasks.json
├── docker-compose.hasura.yaml
├── engine
│  ├── auth_config.json
│  ├── metadata.json
│  └── open_dd.json
├── hasura.yaml
├── supergraph
│  ├── .env.supergraph
│  ├── auth-config.hml
│  ├── compatibility-config.hml
│  └── graphql-config.hml
└── supergraph.yaml
```

You now have all the scaffolding necessary to start developing your Hasura supergraph.
