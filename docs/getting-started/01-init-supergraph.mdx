# Create a Supergraph

With a single subgraph created, we can initialize our [**supergraph**](/project-configuration/config.mdx#supergraph). A
supergraph is equivalent to an API, and these terms can be used interchangeably. Your supergraph is the composite of all
your subgraphs and their various data sources, including custom business logic.

To init your supergraph, from an empty directory, run:

```bash
ddn supergraph init --dir . --with-project <project-name>
```

    The CLI will scaffold out all the files needed for local development and iteration, including a docker-compose. Click here to see the project structure.

```bash
├── docker-compose.hasura.yaml
├── engine
│   ├── auth_config.json
│   ├── metadata.json
│   └── open_dd.json
├── hasura.yaml
├── supergraph
│   ├── auth-config.hml
│   ├── compatibility-config.hml
│   └── graphql-config.hml
├── supergraph.yaml
└── <first-subgraph>
```

</details>

You now have all the scaffolding necessary to start developing your supergraph by connecting your first data source.
