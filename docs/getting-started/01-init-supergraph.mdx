# Create a Supergraph

We'll start our journey by initializing our [**supergraph**](/project-configuration/config.mdx#supergraph). Your
supergraph is the composite of all your subgraphs and their various data sources, including custom business logic.

To init your supergraph, from an empty directory, run:

```bash
ddn supergraph init --dir . --with-project <project-name>
```

The CLI will scaffold out all the files needed for local development and iteration, including a docker-compose.

```bash
├── docker-compose.hasura.yaml
├── engine
│   ├── auth_config.json
│   ├── metadata.json
│   └── open_dd.json
├── hasura.yaml
├── supergraph
│   ├── auth-config.hml
│   ├── compatibility-config.hml
│   └── graphql-config.hml
├── supergraph.yaml
```

</details>

You now have all the scaffolding necessary to start developing your supergraph by connecting your first data source.
