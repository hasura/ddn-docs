# Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you've completed the following things:

## Step 1. Install the Hasura CLI

<InstallTheCli/>

## Step 2. Install the Hasura VS Code extension

If you don't already have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed, install it and then install the
[Hasura extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura).

## Step 3. Install Docker

Finally, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), which will be used for local development.

At this point, you're ready to create your first supergraph!
