import InstallTheCli from '@site/src/components/_install-the-cli/_install-the-cli.mdx';

# Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you've completed the following things:

## Step 1. Install the Hasura CLI

<InstallTheCli/>

## Step 2. Install the Hasura VS Code, LSP extension {#install-lsp}

If you don't already have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed, install it and then install the
[Hasura extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura).

## Step 3. Install Docker

Finally, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), which will be used for local development.

## Next Steps

At this point, you're most likely ready to [create your first supergraph](/getting-started/01-init-supergraph.mdx)!

Alternatively, if you've been invited to an existing supergraph repository, you might want to add a new subgraph,
connect a data source, create a relationship, or add some business logic.
