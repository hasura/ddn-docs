# Explore a Finished API

## Overview

:::tip Check out a sample project's console

If you already have a Hasura Cloud account, you can instantly check out a sample project's console
[here](https://console.hasura.io/project/vast-buzzard-8147/build/37008832ab/explorer/supergraph)!

Navigating the world of APIs can often feel like an arduous journey fraught with obstacles. The process of sharing APIs
for testing and consumption presents numerous challenges that can hinder you and your team's efficiency and
productivity.

From setting up environments, to visualizing API structures, to monitoring and analyzing your API's efficiency, the
difficulties faced by developers are non-trivial and can slow you down. Core issues include:

- **Manual Setup:** Developers manually configure API environments, leading to inconsistencies and errors.
- **Lack of Visualization:** Understanding the structure and relationships within an API is challenging without proper
  visualization tools.
- **Limited Insights:** Monitoring API performance and identifying bottlenecks requires integrating multiple tools,
  which can be cumbersome and disjointed.

Hasura solves this with an easy-to-use GUI called the **console**.

## What is the console?

The console is a web-based GUI that allows you and your team to interact with, visualize, explore, and monitor your API.
It can be used with your local development instance and with your hosted project.

The console makes it easy to test queries, provide feedback, explore iterations of your API, discover data, and diagnose
bottlenecks or errors.

## Explore an API

### Step 1: Create an account or Login

Either create a new account or login to your existing account as [https://console.hasura.io](https://console.hasura.io).

### Step 2: Create a project or explore our sample project

You can follow our [quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx) to create your own project on Hasura DDN. Or, if you
want to easily see what Hasura can do, you can start exploring a finished API with ease.

To explore a sample eCommerce API built on Hasura DDN ([source code](https://github.com/hasura/ddn-sample-app)), simply
head to the [DDN console](https://console.hasura.io/projects). You should see an "eCommerce App" sample project under
**Sample Projects**. Then, to get started with the console, head [here](/getting-started/explore/explore-your-api.mdx)
to learn how to start using the explorer.
