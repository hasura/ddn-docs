# Explore a Finished API

## Overview

Navigating the world of APIs can often feel like an arduous journey fraught with obstacles. The process of sharing APIs
for testing and consumption presents numerous challenges that can hinder you and your team's efficiency and
productivity.

From setting up environments, to visualizing API structures, to monitoring and analyzing your API's efficiency, the
difficulties faced by developers are non-trivial and can slow you down. Core issues include:

- **Manual Setup:** Developers manually configure API environments, leading to inconsistencies and errors.
- **Lack of Visualization:** Understanding the structure and relationships within an API is challenging without proper
  visualization tools.
- **Limited Insights:** Monitoring API performance and identifying bottlenecks requires integrating multiple tools,
  which can be cumbersome and disjointed.

Hasura solves this with an easy-to-use GUI called the **console**.

## What is the console?

The console is a web-based GUI that allows you and your team to interact with, visualize, explore, and monitor your API.
It can be used with your local development instance and with your hosted project.

The console makes it easy to test queries, provide feedback, explore iterations of your API, discover data, and diagnose
bottlenecks or errors.

:::tip Try it out yourself

If you don't have your own DDN API, and want to easily see what the console can do, you can start exploring a finished
API with ease.

To explore a sample eCommerce API built on Hasura DDN ([source code](https://github.com/hasura/ddn-sample-app)), simply
head to the [DDN console](https://console.hasura.io/projects). You should see a "eCommerce App" sample project under
**Example Projects**.
