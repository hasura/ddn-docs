# Explore your API

## Overview

Exploring an API's structure and relationships is often problematic, posing significant challenges to developers and
teams. The reliance on limited external tools can result in incomplete or inaccurate representations of the API, making
it difficult to fully understand its complexities.

Manual documentation further complicates the process, as it is time-consuming to create and update, and is prone to
errors. Additionally, coordinating across teams without a shared understanding of the API can lead to miscommunication
and delays, hampering efficient development. These issues underscore the need for more robust and integrated solutions.

The console's — Hasura's web-based GUI — explorer page offers:

- **Comprehensive Visualization:** See a complete, real-time visual representation of your API, including relationships
  and permissions.
- **Auto-Generated Documentation:** Automatically generate and update API documentation, ensuring consistency and
  accuracy.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Foster better communication and coordination across teams with a shared, intuitive visual
  tool.

You can also use the console to [interact with](/getting-started/explore/interact.mdx) and
[monitor](/getting-started/explore/monitor.mdx) your API.

## Step 1. Explore your supergraph

Click on the `Explorer` button in the sidenav to quickly and easily see a visualization of your entire supergraph:

  alt="Visualization of the entire supergraph"
  width="1000px"
/>

This provides a high-level overview of your entire supergraph. You can see the various subgraphs, their data sources,
and any relationships present within or between subgraphs. You can also adjust the view options to project different
layouts, helping you represent your data in the most effective and informative way to suit your needs.

## Step 2. Explore a subgraph

By clicking on an individual subgraph, you'll see only its details: the connectors belonging to it, and their models and
commands.

## Step 3. Explore a data source

If you have a high number of connectors within a subgraph, it may be easier to view a single data source's models and
commands by clicking on the connector. The UI will focus on this single connector and its related entities.

## Step 4. Explore a model or command

The console allows you to search for any entity within your supergraph by name. In the example below, we're typing
`Carts` and then selecting the option that's returned under the `experience` subgraph's `pg` connector:

From this detailed page, you can see a graph or ERD visualization of an entity, see the GraphQL root fields available,
list all available relationships and permissions, and even execute a sample query!

### Signature and GraphQL root fields

The console allows you to search for any entity within your supergraph by name. In the example below, we're typing
`Carts` and then selecting the option that's returned under the `experience` subgraph's `pg` connector:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/graphql-root-field-and-signature.png" alt="Visualization of the carts model" width="1000px" />

From this detailed page, you can see a graph or ERD visualization of an entity, see the GraphQL root fields available,
list all available relationships and permissions, and even execute a sample query!

### Output fields

Output fields define the structure and types of data that can be retrieved from a model and command. In the example below, for the `Cart` model, the output fields might include:
id (Uuid!): A unique identifier for each cart and other fields as well.


<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/fields.png" alt="Visualization of the carts model" width="1000px" />

These fields allow you to query and retrieve specific information about each cart in your application. The `!` indicates that the field is non-nullable, meaning it will always have a value.

### Relationships

Relationships define how a model or command connects to other models or commands in your database. For the Cart model:
The `user` relationship links a `cart` to its owner in the `Users` table.
This connection is made through the userId field in the Cart model, which corresponds to the id field in the Users table.

This structure allows you to easily access related user data when working with carts, enhancing the flexibility of your queries.

### Permissions

Permissions define access control for different roles interacting with the model or command. For the `Cart` model:
This configuration means that users with the admin role can view cart information but cannot create new carts, modify existing ones, or delete them. This read-only access allows admins to monitor cart activity without making changes.

## Next steps

Now that you have the knowledge to explore your API, let's see how easy it is to
[interact with and test your API](/getting-started/explore/interact.mdx) using the GraphiQL explorer.
