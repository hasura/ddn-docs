# Interact with your API

## Overview

Interacting with your API should be a straightforward task, yet it often turns into a complex and frustrating process.
Developers frequently find themselves switching between multiple tools to test queries, add headers, and trace requests.
This fragmented approach not only slows down the workflow but also leads to inefficiencies in debugging. Without
integrated tracing, identifying and resolving issues becomes time-consuming.

Moreover, the lack of real-time feedback means that any changes to the API or queries require manual verification,
further slowing down development. Recognizing these pain points, Hasura DDN offers a comprehensive solution through its
GraphiQL explorer, designed to simplify and accelerate the API interaction process.

With Hasura DDN, you can use our GraphiQL explorer to create and test queries directly within the console, providing:

- **Schema Definition:** See the entire GraphQL schema and documentation for all available queries and mutations.
- **Integrated Query Testing:** Test queries with headers and see real-time results, all in one place.
- **Built-in Tracing:** Instantly trace queries to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize efficiently.
- **Streamlined Workflow:** Save time and reduce context-switching by having everything you need in a single interface.

You can also use the console to [visualize](/getting-started/explore/visualize.mdx) and
[monitor](/getting-started/explore/monitor.mdx) your API.

## Features

Below, you'll find information about the different features present in the GraphiQL explorer. You can navigate to
GraphiQL by clicking on `GraphiQL` in the left-hand sidenav of the console, our web-based GUI.

### Build manager

At the top of the page, you can switch between a build's API or a project's API. Hasura DDN utilizes a system of
immutable [builds](/project-configuration/builds.mdx) which allow you to iteratively create your API.

This component makes it easy to switch between different builds, test them, provide feedback, and fine-tune your API's
settings.

You can **apply** a build via the console to have it serve your API's endpoint.

### Editable headers

You can add headers using the header table below the build manager. By default, two headers are present: `content-type`
and `hasura_cloud_pat`.

Most often, you'll use the headers table to either pass in custom session variables (e.g., `x-hasura-role`) or
authentication tokens (such as using the Bearer strategy with a [JWT](/auth/authentication/jwt/index.mdx)).

This allows you to easily test permissions and relationships to ensure queries and mutations behave as expected.

:::warning content-type is required

The API expects `content-type` to be present. Removing it will return an error.

### Schema definition

Your API's schema definition is available by default in the GraphiQL explorer. Each query is prefixed by the subgraph's
name and can be clicked through to generate a query to test. Additionally, you can click the book icon to explore your
API's documentation.

### Query testing

In addition to clicking through the queries in the explorer, you can write your queries in the `request` section on the
left-hand side of the GraphiQL component. If you're not sure of what to type next, or which fields are available, you
can press `CTRL` + `SPACE` to bring up the available options.

Further, you can add variables for dynamic queries using the `Variables` section below the query itself.

Your response will be returned on the right-hand side of the component.

Below is a sample query and response using our sample e-commerce application:

```graphql
query UsersAndOrders {
  users_users {
    id
    name
    orders {
      id
      createdAt
      status
    }
  }
}
```

Here, we've used our API to make a query to our `users` table, which exists in a database that belongs to our `users`
subgraph. This subgraph owns information about user profiles. Additionally, because of the relationships present in our
API, we're able to also return related information from our `sales` subgraph — which is owned by a different team — that
contains information in an `orders` table.

:::info Out of the box

Automatically, Hasura DDN provides you with queries for unique, many, aggregation, and filtering!

:::

### Traces

You can instantly view a trace for any query using the `View Trace` button in the bottom-right corner of the GraphiQL
explorer. Here, you can see information like the query details, each step in the execution process, the topology of the
query, and execution plan.
