# Explore a Finished API

## Overview

:::tip Try it out yourself

To start exploring a finished API with ease, create a [Hasura Cloud account](https://console.hasura.io) and access the
sample project through our user-friendly GUI, the **console**.

:::

Sharing APIs for testing and consumption is traditionally a complex and time-consuming process. The status quo often
involves:

- **Manual Setup:** Developers manually configure API environments, leading to inconsistencies and errors.
- **Lack of Visualization:** Understanding the structure and relationships within an API is challenging without proper
  visualization tools.
- **Limited Insights:** Monitoring API performance and identifying bottlenecks requires integrating multiple tools,
  which can be cumbersome and disjointed.

## Interact with your API

Interacting with your API should be straightforward, yet it often involves:

- **Multiple Tools:** Switching between different tools to test queries, add headers, and trace requests.
- **Inefficient Debugging:** Debugging issues without integrated tracing leads to longer resolution times.
- **Lack of Real-time Feedback:** Changes to the API or queries may require manual verification, slowing down
  development.

With Hasura DDN, you can use our GraphiQL explorer to create and test queries directly within the console, providing:

- **Integrated Query Testing:** Test queries with headers and see real-time results, all in one place.
- **Built-in Tracing:** Instantly trace queries to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize efficiently.
- **Streamlined Workflow:** Save time and reduce context-switching by having everything you need in a single interface.

### Test a query

Using the sample application, click on the `GraphiQL` button in the sidenav and enter the following query:

```graphql
query UsersAndOrders {
  users_users {
    id
    name
    orders {
      id
      createdAt
      status
    }
  }
}
```

You should see a response like this:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/users-and-orders-query.png" alt="Sample query" width="1000px" />

Here, we've used our API to make a query to our `users` table, which exists in a database that belongs to our `users`
subgraph. This subgraph owns information about user profiles. Additionally, because of the relationships present in our
API, we're able to also return related information from our `sales` subgraph — which is owned by a different team — that
contains information in an `orders` table.

### View a trace

You can instantly view a trace for any query using the `View Trace` button in the bottom-right corner of the GraphiQL
explorer. Here, you can see information like the query details, each step in the execution process, the topology of the
query, and execution plan.

:::info Out of the box

Automatically, Hasura DDN provides you with queries for unique, many, aggregation, and filtering! Plus, thanks to
GraphQL's self-documenting nature, you can instantly access your API's documentation using GraphiQL.

## Visualize your API

Visualizing an API's structure and relationships is often problematic due to:

- **Limited Tools:** Relying on external tools that may not provide a complete or accurate representation.
- **Manual Documentation:** Creating and updating API documentation manually is time-consuming and prone to errors.
- **Coordination Challenges:** Collaborating across teams without a shared understanding of the API can lead to
  miscommunication and delays.

The console's explorer page offers:

- **Comprehensive Visualization:** See a complete, real-time visual representation of your API, including relationships
  and permissions.
- **Auto-Generated Documentation:** Automatically generate and update API documentation, ensuring consistency and
  accuracy.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Foster better communication and coordination across teams with a shared, intuitive visual
  tool.

### Visualize your supergraph

Click on the `Explorer` button in the sidenav to quickly and easily see a visualization of your entire supergraph:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Visualization of the entire supergraph"
  width="1000px"
/>

### Drill into specifics

The console allows you to search for any entity within your supergraph by name. Let's try it out by typing `Carts` and
then selecting the option that's returned under the `experience` subgraph's `pg` connector:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/carts-visualization.png" alt="Visualization of the carts model" width="1000px" />

From this detailed page, you can see a graph or ERD visualization of an entity, see the GraphQL root fields available,
list all available relationships and permissions, and even execute a sample query!

## Monitor your API

Monitoring API performance and obtaining insights is crucial but often hindered by:

- **Disparate Tools:** Using multiple, unintegrated tools to gather performance metrics.
- **Delayed Insights:** Waiting for data aggregation and analysis can slow down decision-making.
- **Complex Configurations:** Setting up monitoring tools and maintaining them requires significant effort and
  expertise.

Hasura DDN simplifies performance monitoring by providing:

- **Instant Insights:** Access key metrics and traces in real-time on the insights page.
- **Integrated Monitoring:** Monitor performance directly within the console without needing additional tools.
- **Proactive Optimization:** Quickly identify and address performance issues, ensuring a smooth and efficient API
  experience.

### See performance metrics at a glance

From the `Insights` button on the sidenav, you can access key performance metrics for both your project and for each
build:

### Diagnose bottlenecks using traces

You can also click the `Traces` tab at the top of the page and get query-by-query trace data for each request, seeing
all the same details as when using the `View Trace` button in the GraphiQL explorer.
