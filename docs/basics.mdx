# Hasura DDN Basics

## Why are we building Hasura DDN?

With the rapid evolution of digital experiences, businesses are constantly seeking solutions to build next-generation
applications efficiently and cost-effectively. However, a common bottleneck is the inability to swiftly provide secure
and efficient access to necessary data.

Hasura DDN addresses this challenge, utilizing the **[data supergraph](#what-is-a-supergraph)** architecture and
development methodology in a way which unlocks enhanced team and developer productivity.

### The reduction of traditional microservices and APIs

With Hasura DDN the need for server or client side data connecting API services is massively reduced as applications can
now query the Hasura generated API layer directly so that developers are now able to build and ship modern, performant
apps and APIs 10x faster.


### What is a data supergraph? {#what-is-a-supergraph}

At its core, a supergraph allows you to combine multiple sources of data into one unified graph API, allowing disparate
data entities and operations to seamlessly interconnect.

A data supergraph merges the best of two worlds:

- The efficiency of a centralized monolithic approach with its easier governance and cohesion.
- The flexibility and scalability benefits traditionally offered by microservices including ownership management and
  loose coupling.

Today, supergraphs are more critical than ever due to the explosion of data sources and increasing microservice sprawl
leading to slower time-to-market, difficult data interconnection, complex permissioning, ballooning tech-debt, with
slow and complicated team communication.

With supergraphs, teams can combat these issues, leading to better products, faster launches, manageable product
evolution, and seamless team interactions.

The supergraph pattern has been adopted by organizations such as Netflix, Airbnb, Goldman Sachs, and LinkedIn.


## What is the Hasura Data Delivery Network (DDN)?

Hasura DDN is a paradigm shift in data API creation and management. Based on the new Open Data Domain Specification
(OpenDD spec), Hasura DDN facilitates the rapid declarative scaffolding and deployment of an API layer that can be
configured to connect to virtually any data source.

Basically, Hasura DDN is fast, feature-complete, easy, secure and interconnected APIs for all your data, from global
enterprise scale to weekend hobby project.

With Hasura Cloud, these APIs are instantly made available on the edge, delivering ultra-performant production-grade
APIs.

- **OpenDD Spec**: The backbone of Hasura API development, allowing you to define the structure of metadata.
- **Native Data Connector (NDC) Specification**: Community-centric tools to build data connector agents, supporting a
  diverse range of data sources.
- **Hasura Runtime Engine**: Built with Rust, this engine serves APIs based on the OpenDD spec.
- **Hasura Cloud & Data Delivery Network**: Ensures global API performance


## What is available to use in the Alpha release?

The Alpha release offers an initial look into the power of Hasura DDN:

- **API Authoring**

- **Hasura3 CLI**: A revamped Command-Line Interface for improved developer interactions.
- **Hasura Console**: A UI for viewing metadata, relationships and running API queries.Â 
- **LSP**: Language Server Protocol - a parser and validator for the OpenDD Specification.

- **GraphQL API Features**

- **Queries**: Other GraphQL operations coming soon.
- **Mutations** - via Commands [CQRS pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs) and
  NOT database inserts
- **Permissions**, **Relationships** (Supergraph architecture)
- **Relay**: definition

- **CI/CD**

- **Secure Connect -**
- **Builds**: Each metadata change in Hasura DDN represents an immutable build. Every build has a unique GraphQL
  Endpoint that can be tested independently.
- **Projects**: Builds are tied to projects and there is a one-to-many mapping between projects and builds
- **Collaborators**: A way to work together in Cloud projects.
- **Namespaces**: A system to modularize metadata for better team collaboration.
- **Secrets**: a means of storing sensitive information as key-value pairs that you don't want exposed in your metadata.

- **Connectors**

- **Native Data Connector SDKs:** Rust and Typescript
- **Official Connectors**: Postgres, Clickhouse, Sendgrid, Typescript with Deno.


## WIP: How to provide your feedback on Alpha?

Your feedback is invaluable. To provide feedback:

- You can click the feedback form at the bottom of the relevant docs page
- Issues and discussions in Github (feedback) repo?


## What are the known limitations of the Alpha release?

Being the first glimpse into Hasura DDN, the Alpha release comes with some limitations:

- **Mutations and Subscriptions**: Coming soon!
- **Compatibility**: While the default GraphQL schema is compatible with Hasura v2, some advanced v2 features might not
  be supported.
- **Migration Tools**: Complete migration tools from Hasura v2 to DDN are in development.
- **Data Connectors**: Not all previously supported data sources have connectors yet; however, the NDC SDKs will soon
  bridge this gap.


## What is the timeline for upcoming releases?

The specific timeline for Hasura DDN will vary based on feature development and improvements. We're dedicated to
delivering a robust and trustworthy release. For the most current updates, always refer to our official announcements
and release notes.

Thank you for being a part of this exciting journey with Hasura DDN. Your participation drives our innovation, and
together, we'll reshape the future of modern application development.
