# Hasura DDN Basics

## Why are we building Hasura DDN?

With the rapid evolution of digital experiences, businesses are constantly seeking solutions to build next-generation
applications efficiently and cost-effectively. However, a common bottleneck is the inability to swiftly provide secure
and efficient access to necessary data.

Hasura DDN addresses this challenge, by utilizing the **[data supergraph](#what-is-a-supergraph)** architecture and
development methodology in a way which unlocks improved team and developer productivity.

### Meeting the growing needs of our developer community

In speaking with developers building APIs and microservices, we realized the community is faced with significant
challenges. Hasura DDN was built to address these problems and simplify the lives of software developers and architects
everywhere. The major challenges we will solve with DDN are:

- Feature-rich domain modeling
- Composability across diverse data domains
- Rapid building, authoring and iteration Experience
- Performance / Operational overhead
- Zero-downtime rollouts and no breaking changes
- Bringing programming language framework of choice
- Edge and distributed topology
- Rapid onboarding and discovery of data domains
- Federated CI/CD across multiple teams
- Data connectivity options and flexibility

### The reduction of traditional microservices & APIs

With Hasura DDN, the need for server or client-side API services is significantly reduced as applications can now query
the Hasura generated API layer directly so that developers can build and ship modern, performant apps and APIs 10x
faster.

### What is a data supergraph? {#what-is-a-supergraph}

At its core, a supergraph allows you to combine multiple sources of data into one unified graph API, allowing disparate
data entities and operations to seamlessly interconnect.

A data supergraph merges the best of two worlds:

- The efficiency of a centralized monolithic approach with its easier governance and cohesion.
- The flexibility and scalability benefits traditionally offered by microservices including ownership management and
  loose coupling.

Today, supergraphs are more critical than ever due to the explosion of data sources and increasing microservice sprawl
leading to slower time-to-market, difficult data interconnection, complex permissioning, ballooning tech-debt, with slow
and complicated team communication.

With supergraphs, teams can combat these issues, leading to better products, faster launches, manageable product
evolution, and seamless team interactions.

The supergraph pattern has been adopted by organizations such as Netflix, Airbnb, Goldman Sachs, and LinkedIn.

## What is the Hasura Data Delivery Network (DDN)?

Hasura DDN is a paradigm shift in data API creation and management and how we think about data domains in response to
the evolved requirements of our users. Based on the new Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD spec) and Native Data
Connector Specifications (NDC spec), Hasura DDN facilitates the rapid declarative scaffolding and deployment of an API
layer that can be configured to connect to virtually any data source. With Hasura DDN, we are introducing a new approach
to microservices development that is designed to provide, both in developer workflow and final product: a faster, more
powerful, agile, and scalable solution for building modern applications.

For more details please refer to the [FAQ section in the docs](/faq.mdx).

## What is the Alpha release?

The Alpha release is the first public rollout of the Hasura Data Delivery Network geared towards a limited use-case set.

This is an opportunity for our engaged community to have early access to DDN and explore this significant update to the
platform. We encourage our users to be true design partners providing feedback and suggestions as we take the platform
towards general availability. We invite community members to let us know their thoughts and questions
[here](https://discord.com/channels/407792526867693568/1164275846538874900) and engage with our product and engineering
teams. To enable frictionless evaluation DDN, Alpha is completely free for 90 days for all Alpha users. We are rapidly
evolving the platform and will keep you updated with the progress.

Please note that there could be some breaking changes introduced in the Alpha version, however we will make sure not to
introduce any drastic changes. In most instances, it would require you to create new builds without the need for
refactoring the entire metadata. We will give you advance notice before any such changes are rolled out in production.
Also, customer support will be limited during this phase and most of the communication wil happen via direct
conversation with the Hasura team via discord channels, user groups, emails, and community calls.

## What is available to use in the Alpha release?

The Alpha release offers an initial look into the power of Hasura DDN:

### API Authoring

- **VS Code Extension:** [A VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) for
  Hasura DDN that provides a rich editing experience for OpenDD metadata.
- **LSP:** Language Server Protocol - a parser and validator for the OpenDD Specification that powers the VS Code
  extension.
- **Hasura Console:** [A UI](https://console.hasura.io) for creating projects, viewing metadata, relationships and
  running API queries.

### GraphQL API Features

- **Queries:** Other GraphQL operations coming soon.
- [**Mutations:** via Commands](/data-domain-modeling/commands.mdx)
  ([CQRS pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs)). True database inserts, updates,
  and deletes via the respective data connectors are coming soon.
- [**Permissions:**](/auth/authorization/index.mdx) An OpenDD metadata object in Hasura DDN that defines the access
  control or authorization rules on models and commands.
- [**Relationships:**](/data-domain-modeling/relationships.mdx) An OpenDD metadata object in Hasura DDN that defines the
  relationship between two models or between a model and a command. This facilitates data interconnection
- [**Relay:**](/data-domain-modeling/global-id.mdx) The Relay global ID enables fetching any object directly, regardless
  of what kind of object it is.

### CI/CD

- [**Hasura3 CLI:**](/cli/overview.mdx) A revamped Command-Line Interface for improved developer interactions.
- **Secure Connect:** A feature in Hasura DDN that creates secure tunnels to connect with local resources, aiding local
  development while ensuring data security. It requires a local daemon to be run via the CLI.
- [**Builds:**](/ci-cd/builds.mdx) Each metadata change in Hasura DDN represents an immutable build. Every build has a
  unique GraphQL Endpoint that can be tested independently.
- [**Projects:**](/ci-cd/projects.mdx) Builds are tied to projects and there is a one-to-many mapping between projects
  and builds
- [**Collaborators:**](/ci-cd/collaborators.mdx) A way to work together in Cloud projects.
- [**Subgraphs:**](/ci-cd/subgraphs.mdx) A system to modularize metadata for better team collaboration.
