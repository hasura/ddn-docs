# Hasura DDN Basics

## Why are we building Hasura DDN?

With the rapid evolution of digital experiences, businesses are constantly seeking solutions to build next-generation
applications efficiently and cost-effectively. However, a common bottleneck is the inability to swiftly provide secure
and efficient access to necessary data.

Hasura DDN addresses this challenge, by utilizing the **[data supergraph](#what-is-a-supergraph)** architecture and
development methodology in a way which unlocks improved team and developer productivity.

### The reduction of traditional microservices and APIs

With Hasura DDN, the need for server or client-side API services is significantly reduced as applications can now
query the Hasura generated API layer directly so that developers can build and ship modern, performant apps and APIs
10x faster.

### What is a data supergraph? {#what-is-a-supergraph}

At its core, a supergraph allows you to combine multiple sources of data into one unified graph API, allowing disparate
data entities and operations to seamlessly interconnect.

A data supergraph merges the best of two worlds:

- The efficiency of a centralized monolithic approach with its easier governance and cohesion.
- The flexibility and scalability benefits traditionally offered by microservices including ownership management and
  loose coupling.

Today, supergraphs are more critical than ever due to the explosion of data sources and increasing microservice sprawl
leading to slower time-to-market, difficult data interconnection, complex permissioning, ballooning tech-debt, with
slow and complicated team communication.

With supergraphs, teams can combat these issues, leading to better products, faster launches, manageable product
evolution, and seamless team interactions.

The supergraph pattern has been adopted by organizations such as Netflix, Airbnb, Goldman Sachs, and LinkedIn.


## What is the Hasura Data Delivery Network (DDN)?

Hasura DDN is a paradigm shift in data API creation and management. Based on the new Open Data Domain Specification
(OpenDD spec), Hasura DDN facilitates the rapid declarative scaffolding and deployment of an API layer that can be
configured to connect to virtually any data source.

Basically, Hasura DDN comprises fast, feature-complete, easy, secure and interconnected APIs for all your data, from
global enterprise scale to weekend hobby project.

With Hasura Cloud, these APIs are instantly made available on the edge, delivering ultra-performant production-grade
APIs.

- **OpenDD Spec**: The backbone of Hasura API development, allowing you to define the structure of metadata.
- **Native Data Connector (NDC) Specification**: Community-centric tools to build data connector agents, supporting a
  diverse range of data sources.
- **Hasura Runtime Engine**: Built from the ground up with Rust, this engine serves APIs based on the OpenDD spec.
- **Hasura Cloud & Data Delivery Network**: Ensures global API performance


## What is available to use in the Alpha release?

The Alpha release offers an initial look into the power of Hasura DDN:

### API Authoring

- **VS Code Extension:** [A VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) for
  Hasura DDN that provides a rich editing experience for OpenDD metadata.
- **LSP:** Language Server Protocol - a parser and validator for the OpenDD Specification that powers the VS Code
  extension.
- **Hasura Console:** [A UI](https://console.hasura.io) for creating projects, viewing metadata, relationships and
  running API queries.

### GraphQL API Features

- **Queries:** Other GraphQL operations coming soon.
- [**Mutations:** via Commands](/data-domain-modeling/commands.mdx)
([CQRS pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs)). True database inserts, updates,
and deletes via the respective data connectors are coming soon.
- [**Permissions:**](/auth/authorization/index.mdx) An OpenDD metadata object in Hasura DDN that defines the access
control or authorization rules on models and commands.
- [**Relationships:**](/data-domain-modeling/relationships.mdx) An OpenDD metadata object in Hasura DDN that defines
the relationship between two models or between a model and a command. This facilitates data interconnection
- [**Relay:**](/data-domain-modeling/global-id.mdx) The Relay global ID enables fetching any object directly,
regardless of what kind of object it is.

### CI/CD

- [**Hasura3 CLI:**](/cli/overview.mdx) A revamped Command-Line Interface for improved developer interactions.
- **Secure Connect:** A feature in Hasura DDN that creates secure tunnels to connect with local resources, aiding local
  development while ensuring data security. It requires a local daemon to be run via the CLI.
- [**Builds:**](/ci-cd/builds.mdx) Each metadata change in Hasura DDN represents an immutable build. Every build has a
unique GraphQL
  Endpoint that can be tested independently.
- [**Projects:**](/ci-cd/projects.mdx) Builds are tied to projects and there is a one-to-many mapping between projects
and builds
- [**Collaborators:**](/ci-cd/collaborators.mdx) A way to work together in Cloud projects.
- [**Namespaces:**](/ci-cd/subgraphs.mdx) A system to modularize metadata for better team collaboration.
- [**Secrets:**](/ci-cd/secrets.mdx) a means of storing sensitive information as key-value pairs that you don't want
exposed in your
metadata.

### SDKs and Connectors {#sdks-and-connectors}

- **Native Data Connector SDKs:** [Rust](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub#rust-sdk) and
[Typescript](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript)
- **Official Connectors:** [Postgres](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-postgres),
[Clickhouse](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-clickhouse), [Sendgrid](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid),
[Typescript with Deno](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-typescript-deno).

## What are the known limitations of the Alpha release?

Being the first glimpse into Hasura DDN, the Alpha release comes with some limitations:

- **Mutations and Subscriptions:** Coming soon! Mutations can be performed via
[Commands](/data-domain-modeling/commands.mdx) in the alpha release though.
- **Compatibility:** While the default GraphQL schema is compatible with Hasura v2, some advanced v2 features might not
  be supported.
- **Migration Tools:** Complete migration tools from Hasura v2 to DDN are in development.
- **Data Connectors:** Not all previously supported data sources have connectors yet; however, the
[NDC SDKs](#sdks-and-connectors) will soon bridge this gap.


## What is the timeline for upcoming releases?

The specific timeline for Hasura DDN will vary based on feature development and improvements. We're dedicated to
delivering a robust and trustworthy release. For the most current updates, always refer to our official announcements
and release notes.

Thank you for being a part of this exciting journey with Hasura DDN. Your participation drives our innovation, and
together, we'll reshape the future of modern application development.


## Moving to a supergraph architecture

### Before Hasura DDN

Businesses, while modernizing, face challenges in delivering digital experiences quickly and cost-effectively.
Product development teams are often bottle-necked, waiting on backend teams for secure and efficient data access. This
results in manually implementing custom APIs, microservice sprawl, orchestrating security policies, wasting time and
stifling innovation.

### After Hasura DDN

In moving to a supergraph architecture with Hasura, organizations can significantly minimize the complexity of their
data infrastructure. By connecting directly to data sources via Hasura DDN and native data connectors (NDCs), the
requirement for hand-crafted APIs and microservices is vastly reduced and collaboration is enhanced with backend teams
contributing independently.

Data can be securely exposed and interconnected, allowing for the creation of a single, unified data graph, able to
be deployed for wide-ranging requirements from client apps to public APIs on globally distributed infrastructure for
minimal latency, scalability, and unwavering reliability.
