# Architecture

import Thumbnail from "@site/src/components/Thumbnail";

## Introduction

Subgraph federation in Hasura DDN upgrades how you build and manage GraphQL APIs. Federation is the process of combining
multiple subgraphs into a single supergraph.

This architecture promotes a collaborative development workflow which allows teams to independently develop and deploy
subgraphs to the supergraph, while maintaining strong governance with permissions and access control on the development
process.

### Subgraphs

In Hasura DDN, a subgraph represents a self-contained module of metadata and its accompanying data connector(s) which
encapsulates a specific data domain. Subgraphs can be built completely independently of other subgraphs and managed in
their own isolated repositories.

Subgraph fields which are exposed to the full supergraph can be prefixed so as to prevent conflicts in the schema.

### Data Connectors

[Data Connectors](/connectors/overview.mdx) connect subgraphs to their respective data sources. They act as the bridges
that translate GraphQL queries into the native language of the data source. Each subgraph can have one or more data
connectors.

## Benefits

- **Modular Development:** Subgraphs promote modular development by allowing teams to independently develop, test, and
  deploy their code without impacting the functionality of other subgraphs. This modular approach simplifies code
  management and reduces the risk of breaking changes.
- **Independent Deployment:** Subgraphs can be deployed individually, ensuring that updates to one subgraph do not
  require downtime for the entire supergraph. This flexibility allows for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
  practices that accelerate feature releases.
- **Enhanced Scalability:** By dividing the API into smaller, independent subgraphs, Hasura DDN enables efficient
  scaling for individual subgraphs based on their specific requirements. This granular control optimizes resource
  allocation and ensures that each subgraph performs optimally.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Subgraphs allow different teams to focus on their specialized data domains, fostering
  collaboration by enabling them to share their APIs and data through a unified interface. This collaborative
  environment accelerates development and reduces friction between teams.

## Example

Imagine an e-commerce application with separate subgraphs for product catalog management, user profile information, and
order processing.

1. **Product Catalog Subgraph:** A team dedicated to managing product information owns and maintains this subgraph. They
   use a dedicated PostgreSQL data connector to connect to a relational database containing product details, images, and
   inventory data.
2. **User Profile Subgraph:** The UX team owns this subgraph, using a MongoDB data connector to interact with a document
   database containing user profiles, preferences, and order history.
3. **Order Processing Subgraph:** Managed by the fulfillment team, this subgraph utilizes a custom TypeScript connector
   to handle business logic related to order creation, payment processing, and shipment tracking, integrating with
   external APIs and services.

When a client requests product details along with user reviews, the supergraph forwards the query to the Product Catalog
subgraph for product information and the User Profile subgraph for user reviews. These subgraphs, in turn, query their
respective data sources using their dedicated data connectors.
