# Architecture

import Thumbnail from "@site/src/components/Thumbnail";

## Introduction

Subgraph federation in Hasura DDN revolutionizes how you build and manage GraphQL APIs, enabling efficient data
management across multiple, self-contained subgraphs. This architecture promotes a collaborative development
workflow which allows teams to independently develop and deploy subgraphs in the supergraph.

## Building Blocks

In Hasura DDN, a subgraph represents a self-contained module of metadata and its accompanying data connector(s) which
encapsulates a specific data domain.

The **supergraph** orchestrates these subgraphs, stitching together their schemas into a unified and accessible
GraphQL API. This central point of entry simplifies data consumption by hiding the complexities of individual subgraphs
behind a streamlined interface.

### Data Connectors

[Data Connectors](/connectors/overview.mdx) play a connect subgraphs to their respective data sources. They act as
the bridges that translate GraphQL queries into the native language of the data source.

## Benefits

- **Modular Development:** Subgraphs promote modular development by allowing teams to independently develop, test, and
deploy their code without impacting the functionality of other subgraphs. This modular approach simplifies code
management and reduces the risk of breaking changes.
- **Independent Deployment:** Subgraphs can be deployed individually, ensuring that updates to one subgraph do not
require downtime for the entire supergraph. This flexibility allows for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
practices that accelerate feature releases.
- **Enhanced Scalability:** By dividing the API into smaller, independent subgraphs, Hasura DDN enables efficient
scaling for individual subgraphs based on their specific requirements. This granular control optimizes resource
allocation and ensures that each subgraph performs optimally.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Subgraphs allow different teams to focus on their specialized data domains, fostering
collaboration by enabling them to share their APIs and data through a unified interface. This collaborative
environment accelerates development and reduces friction between teams.

## Example

Imagine an e-commerce application with separate subgraphs for product catalog management, user profile information, and
order processing.

1. **Product Catalog Subgraph:** A team dedicated to managing product information owns and maintains this subgraph.
They use a dedicated PostgreSQL data connector to connect to a relational database containing product details,
images, and inventory data.
2. **User Profile Subgraph:** The UX team owns this subgraph, using a MongoDB data connector to interact with a
document database containing user profiles, preferences, and order history.
3. **Order Processing Subgraph:** Managed by the fulfillment team, this subgraph utilizes a custom TypeScript
connector to handle business logic related to order creation, payment processing, and shipment tracking, integrating
with external APIs and services.

When a client requests product details along with user reviews, the supergraph forwards the query to the Product Catalog
subgraph for product information and the User Profile subgraph for user reviews. These subgraphs, in turn, query their
respective data sources using their dedicated data connectors.
