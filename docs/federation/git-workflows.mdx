# Git Workflows

It's important to talk about federation in terms of how you will set up your version control as that will have a big
impact on how you work with your team and how you manage your Hasura DDN project.

## Single Repo vs. Multi-repo Federation

Many smaller projects will only need one repository. Often they will need only one subgraph which connects to one
data source, but of course can have more of both. In the case of a single subgraph setup it would typically be named
something like `app`, `default`, `main` or the name of the data source it connects to.

However, teams working on larger projects may want a [SDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)
and CI/CD which is independent of other teams. This is where multi-repo federation shines. Subgraphs in multi-repo
federation can connect to different data sources, with each subgraph managed in its own repository
for added governance, control and clean separation from other teams work. Subgraphs would also typically be named after
the data domain they encapsulate, such as `users`, `orders`, `products`, etc.

## Single Repo Federation

### Creating a new single repo setup

1. Create a new local supergraph normally as per the [getting started guide](/getting-started/build/index.mdx).
2. Push to a new Git repository.
3. Deploy to Hasura DDN as per the [deployment guide](/getting-started/deployment/index.mdx).
4. Add collaborators to the Hasura DDN project [with appropriate permissions](/getting-started/collaborate/invite/).
5. Add collaborators to the Git repository to allow them to work on the project.
6. DDN project collaborators can add new subgraphs and new data connectors normally, depending on their project
   permissions.

### Joining an existing single repo setup

1. Ensure you have [been invited and accepted](/getting-started/collaborate/invite/) the invite to the Hasura DDN
   project with the correct permissions and have been added as a collaborator the Git repository.
2. Clone the git repository locally.
3. Make your changes, [add more subgraphs](/getting-started/build/init-subgraph) and
   [data connectors](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/index.mdx) as needed.
4. Test your changes locally.
5. [Create a subgraph build](/cli/commands/ddn_subgraph_build_create.mdx) on Hasura DDN.
6. Test with the build URL.
7. Apply the subgraph to the supergraph (if your permissions allow). Otherwise, request the admin or owner to apply the
subgraph.

## Multi-repo Federation (Independent Subgraph Development)

:::info Advanced plan

You will need a project on the [DDN Advanced plan](https://hasura.io/pricing) to use multi-repo federation, also
known as independent subgraph development.

:::

### Creating a new multi-repo setup

The setup here is for a main supergraph repository to be created with the `globals` subgraph and any other subgraph
which other teams will work on. Once on DDN, collaborators are added on the subgraph level giving them permissions
to only work on their subgraph.

:::info Globals Subgraph Objects

By convention, the globals subgraph contains supergraph-level metadata objects that apply to the entire supergraph.
These are `AuthConfig`, `CompatibilityConfig` and `GraphqlConfig` as well as the `Subgraph` object which defines the
globals subgraph itself.

:::

1. As a supergraph admin, create a supergraph normally, as per the
   [getting started guide](/getting-started/build/index.mdx).
2. Create any other subgraphs which other teams will work on as placeholders so that they can be invited to them.
3. Push the supergraph to a new Git repository. Do not add collaborators to this repo, they will be added to their
   own subgraph repositories.
4. Deploy the supergraph to Hasura DDN as per the [deployment guide](/getting-started/deployment/index.mdx).
5. Invite subgraph collaborators to the Hasura DDN project with
   [Subgraph Admin or Subgraph Developer permissions](/getting-started/collaborate/invite/).

### Joining an existing multi-repo setup

In this workflow the collaborator manages a separate supergraph containing just their subgraph and changes
the supergraph context to reference the collaborative project on DDN. The supergraph is fully functional and enables
local development but only contains their subgraph. They can they create subgraph builds on the collaborative DDN project
and if permissions allow, apply the subgraph to the collaborative supergraph.

1. [Accept the invitation](/getting-started/collaborate/invite/) to the Hasura DDN supergraph project.
2. Create a new Git repository for a new project. Or join an existing Git repository.
3. Initialize a new supergraph project with a subgraph locally. Make sure the subgraph is named the same as the
   subgraph you were invited to work on.
4. [Set the supergraph context](/project-configuration/config.mdx#context-file) to the existing Hasura DDN
   project.
5. Run your supergraph locally and develop and test.
6. [Create a subgraph build](/cli/commands/ddn_subgraph_build_create.mdx) on the existing Hasura DDN
   supergraph project.
7. Test with the build URL on Hasura DDN.
8. Apply the subgraph to the supergraph if permissions allow. Otherwise, request the owner or admin to apply the
subgraph.

:::tip Existing code repositories for new projects.

If you already have an existing app or other repository to which you feel it appropriate to add your DDN project
configuration in a new directory, that's fine too!
