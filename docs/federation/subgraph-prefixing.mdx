# Subgraph Prefixing

To avoid collisions between GraphQL root fields and type names across different subgraphs, you can optionally
customize the prefixes for each. For example, if two subgraphs both have a `Users` type, you can apply different
prefixes to distinguish one from the other. This ensures that each subgraph remains unique and prevents any naming
conflicts.

You can make these modifications in the `subgraph.yaml` file for a subgraph.

```yaml title="Add the highlighted lines:"
kind: Subgraph
version: v2
definition:
  name: my_subgraph
  generator:
    rootPath: .
    #highlight-start
    graphqlRootFieldPrefix: my_subgraph_
    graphqlTypeNamePrefix: My_subgraph_
    #highlight-end
```

By default, the `subgraph.yaml` file is generated without any prefixes. You can read more about these fields
[here](supergraph-modeling/build-configs.mdx#subgraph-subgraphgeneratorconfig).
