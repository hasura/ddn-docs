# Subgraph Prefixing

To avoid collisions between GraphQL root fields and type names across when federating subgraphs, you can optionally
customize the prefixes for each. For example, if two subgraphs both have a `Users` type, you can apply different
prefixes to distinguish one from the other. This ensures that each subgraph remains unique and prevents any naming
conflicts.

You can make these modifications in the `subgraph.yaml` file for a subgraph.

```yaml title="Add the highlighted lines:"
kind: Subgraph
version: v2
definition:
  name: my_subgraph
  generator:
    rootPath: .
    #highlight-start
    graphqlRootFieldPrefix: my_subgraph_
    graphqlTypeNamePrefix: My_subgraph_
    #highlight-end
```

By default, the `subgraph.yaml` file is generated without any prefixes. You can read more about these fields
[here](supergraph-modeling/build-configs.mdx#subgraph-subgraphgeneratorconfig).
