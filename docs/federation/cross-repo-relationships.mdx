# Cross-repo Relationships

## Connecting across subgraphs with relationships

When you have multiple subgraphs, either in a single-repo or multi-repo setup, you can query across linked information.
This is done by creating a [`Relationship`](/reference/metadata-reference/relationships.mdx) object in metadata which
defines how fields from one type map to a `model` or `command`.

### Single-repo relationships

In a single-repo setup, relationships are straightforward to manage. All subgraphs are in the same repository and the
[Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) can be used to assist
with authoring relationships, providing auto-complete and validation.

### Cross-repo relationships

:::info Advanced plan

You will need a project on the [DDN Advanced plan](https://hasura.io/pricing) to use multi-repo federation and
cross-repo relationships.

:::

In a multi-repo setup, subgraphs that contain objects you want to relate can reside in different repositories, some of
which you may not have access to. In these cases the Hasura VS Code extension cannot validate the entirety of the
`Relationship` object and you will manually author cross-repo relationships and ensure that the field mappings are
correct. However, upon creating a supergraph build, all cross-subgraph metadata is validated to prevent mistakes from
being deployed to the final API.

You can still easily use the Hasura DDN console to explore the supergraph and test relationships across subgraphs once
you have created a build.

If you perform a _local_ supergraph build using the CLI (ie. `ddn supergraph build local`), cross-repo relationships
will be ignored and will not be validated. If you run the build locally you will only see the subgraphs in that
repository, and any relationships to subgraphs from other repositories will be missing.

### Example

Let's say you have a supergraph with two subgraphs, each managed in different repositories: `users` and `products`.

The `users` subgraph in repo 'A' has a `User` type with a field called `user_favorite_product_id`.

The `products` subgraph in repo 'B' has a `Product` type with a field called `id`.

To create a relationship between these two types in different repositories, you would create a `Relationship` object in
the `users` subgraph metadata as normal.

The LSP is able to understand that the `Product` type is in a different subgraph to which it does not have access and
will not give a warning on the foreign type.

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: favorite_product
  sourceType: User
  target:
    model:
      name: Product
      subgraph: products
      relationshipType: Object
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: user_favorite_product_id
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: id
```

This `Relationship` object defines a relationship called `favorite_product` from the `User` type to the `Product` type.
The `mapping` field specifies how the `user_favorite_product_id` field in the `User` type maps to the `id` field in the
`Product` type.

After defining the cross-repo relationship, it's important to note that you won't be able to test this locally. To see
the relationship in action, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new supergraph build on DDN using the `ddn supergraph build create` command. (Subgraph builds do not get an
   API, so supergraph builds are required to test.)
2. You can then use the Hasura DDN console to explore and test the relationship across subgraphs.
3. If you have admin permissions, you can apply the subgraph to the supergraph with the `ddn subgraph apply` command.

Remember, cross-repo relationships only come into effect when the subgraphs are combined in the DDN environment. Local
development and testing are limited to the scope of your current repository.

With this relationship defined, you can now query the `favorite_product` field on the `User` type to retrieve the
related `Product`.

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    favorite_product {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
