# Multi-repo Federation

Many smaller projects will only need one subgraph which connects to one data source, with everything managed in one
repository. The subgraph would typically be named something like `app`, `default`, `main` or the name of the data
source it connects to.

However, larger projects may require multiple subgraphs, each connecting to different data sources, with each subgraph
managed in a repository for added governance, control and separation from other teams work. This is where multi-repo
federation comes in. Subgraphs would typically be named after the data domain they encapsulate, such as `users`,
`orders`, `products`, etc.
