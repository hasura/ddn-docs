# Git Workflows


It's important to talk about federation in terms of how you will set up your version control as that will have a big
impact on how you work with your team and how you manage your API.

## Single repo vs multi repo federation

Many smaller projects will only need one subgraph which connects to one data source, with everything managed in one
repository. The subgraph would typically be named something like `app`, `default`, `main` or the name of the data
source it connects to.

However, larger projects may require multiple subgraphs, each connecting to different data sources, with each subgraph
managed in a repository for added governance, control and separation from other teams work. This is where multi-repo
federation comes in. Subgraphs would typically be named after the data domain they encapsulate, such as `users`,
`orders`, `products`, etc.
