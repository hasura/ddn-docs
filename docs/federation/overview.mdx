# Data Federation

## Introduction

The concept of data federation is intrinsic to Hasura DDN.

By adding multiple data sources, logic and third-party APIs to multiple subgraphs and stitching those subgraphs
together, you are able to bring together all your data domains owned by multiple teams into one supergraph and query
across all of them in a single elegant request.

These features also enable separate software development life cycles (SDLC) and CI/CD for each subgraph team in the DDN
Advanced plan.
