    <div>
      <p>The concept of data federation is intrinsic to Hasura DDN.</p>
      <p>
        By adding multiple data sources, logic and third-party APIs to multiple subgraphs and stitching those subgraphs
        together, you are able to bring together all your data domains owned by multiple teams into one supergraph and
        query across all of them in a single elegant request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our collaboration features also enable separate software development life cycles (SDLC) and CI/CD for each subgraph team in the DDN Advanced plan.
