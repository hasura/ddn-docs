# Federation Basics

import Thumbnail from "@site/src/components/Thumbnail";

## Introduction

**Federation** in Hasura DDN is the process of combining multiple subgraphs with one or more data sources into a single
supergraph to create a unified GraphQL API that provides access to all your data domains through a single endpoint.

With Hasura DDN's **collaboration** features, you can add collaborators to either the supergraph or subgraph level.

A supergraph API build is a collection of one or more subgraph builds.

## Add a subgraph to a supergraph

To add a subgraph to a supergraph, you need to have a [supergraph project initialized](/quickstart.mdx).

By running `ddn supergraph init .` you would have both an `app` and `globals` subgraph by default.

Additional subgraphs can be added with:

```bash title="Add a subgraph to a supergraph:"
ddn subgraph init my_new_subgraph --dir ./my_new_subgraph --target-supergraph ./supergraph.yaml
```

You can read more about adding a new subgraph to a supergraph in the [Getting Started guide](/quickstart.mdx).

Once a subgraph has been added and built on Hasura DDN, [subgraph collaborators](/collaboration/invite.mdx) can be added
to it.

## Add collaborators

As a project owner, or supergraph admin, you can invite collaborators to either the supergraph or subgraph level.

As a subgraph admin, you can invite collaborators to your subgraph.

Read more about [collaboration](/collaboration/invite.mdx) and the available roles in Hasura DDN.

## Next steps

- [Independent Subgraph Development](/federation/independent-subgraph-development.mdx) enables teams to independently
  develop, test, and deploy their code without impacting the functionality of other subgraphs.
- [Subgraph Prefixing](/federation/subgraph-prefixing.mdx) prevents conflicts in the schema when multiple subgraphs
  expose GraphQL fields and types with the same name.
- [Cross-repo Relationships](/federation/cross-repo-relationships.mdx) allows teams to build data relationships between
  subgraphs that are in separate repositories.
