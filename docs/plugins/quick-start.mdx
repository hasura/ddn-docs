# Quick Start

Hasura gives you the power to add HTTP hooks to different execution steps of the
DDN. Hasura also provides some plugins to get started quickly.

For the quick start, we will use the `allowlist` plugin
([link](https://github.com/hasura/plugin-allowlist)). The `allowlist` plugin
adds an allowlist layer on top of your DDN to restrict access to only specific
queries and mutations.

To get started with the `allowlist` plugin, follow the steps below:

1. **Get the plugin**: Create a wrangler project with the `allowlist` plugin
   template.

    ```bash
    wrangler generate allowlist-plugin https://github.com/hasura/plugin-allowlist
    ```

2. **Configure the plugin**: Update the `wrangler.toml` file with the required
    configurations.

    ```toml
    ...
    [vars]
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "https://gateway.otlp.hasura.io:443/v1/traces"
    OTEL_EXPORTER_PAT = "<PAT>"
    ```
    Replace `<PAT>` with the Personal Access Token (PAT) for the Hasura Cloud
    account.

3. **Update the config**: Update the `src/config.ts` file with the queries
    and mutations that you want to allow. Also use a strong m-auth key.

    ```typescript
    export const Config = {
        headers: {
        "hasura-m-auth": "your-strong-m-auth-key",
        },
        allowlist: [
        ...,
        "query MyQuery {\n  getAuthorById(author_id: 10) {\n    first_name\n    id\n    last_name\n  }\n}",
        ],
    };
    ```
    Replace `your-strong-m-auth-key` with a strong m-auth key.

4. **Local development**: Run the plugin locally.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The plugin will be available at `http://localhost:8787`.

5. **Deploy the plugin**: Deploy the plugin to the Hasura Cloud.

    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

6. **Add the plugin to the Hasura Cloud**: Add the plugin to the Hasura Cloud by
    providing the plugin URL. Create a new HML file (in your subgraph's metadata
    directory) with the plugin configuration.

    ```yaml
    kind: LifecyclePluginHook
    version: v1
    definition:
    name: cloudflare allow list
    url:
        valueFromEnv: ALLOW_LIST_URL
    pre: parse
    config:
        request:
        headers:
            additional:
            hasura-m-auth:
                value: "your-strong-m-auth-key"
        session: {}
        rawRequest:
            query: {}
            variables: {}
    ```
    Replace `your-strong-m-auth-key` with the strong m-auth key.
    Also, update the `ALLOW_LIST_URL` env variable with the plugin URL in the
    `.env` and `.env.cloud` files.

7. **Create a new build**: Create a new supergraph build.

    ```bash
    ddn supergraph build
    ```
    The plugin will be added to the Hasura Cloud.
