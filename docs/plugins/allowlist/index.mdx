# Allowlist Plugin

## Introduction

The [Allowlist Plugin](https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-allowlist) provides a mechanism to restrict access to
your supergraph by defining specific queries or mutations that are allowed. This adds an extra layer of security by
ensuring that only predefined operations can be executed.

The plugin integrates with Hasura DDN as a **pre-parse plugin** and can be deployed as an HTTP service using tools like
Cloudflare Workers or similar services.

Key benefits of the allowlist plugin include:

- **Enhanced security:** Restrict operations to a predefined set.
- **Flexibility:** Supports dynamic configuration through environment variables.
- **Integration:** Works as a pre-parse plugin, ensuring only allowed queries or mutations are processed.

## Next steps

To get started with configuring and deploying the Allowlist Plugin, refer to the [guide](/plugins/allowlist/how-to.mdx),
which walks you through the process of setting up, configuring, and deploying the plugin.
