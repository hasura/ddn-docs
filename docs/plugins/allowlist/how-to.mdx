# How to Configure the Allowlist Plugin

## Introduction

The [allowlist plugin](https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-allowlist) adds an allowlist layer on top of your
supergraph to restrict access to only specific queries or mutations.

:::info We're using Cloudflare Wrangler

In this example, we're using Cloudflare Wrangler to deploy our plugin as a Cloudflare Worker. However, you can use any
other tool or service that hosts HTTPS services you wish. You can get started with Wrangler
[here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

:::

## Step 1. Create a new Worker project

Create a new Cloudflare Worker project using the `create-cloudflare` command with the
[`allowlist` plugin template](https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-allowlist):

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest allowlist-plugin -- --template https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-allowlist
```

## Step 2. Install the dependencies

Navigate to the new directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd allowlist-plugin
npm install
```

Also, start the local development server.

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 3. Add the plugin configuration

We'll let the engine know about the plugin and to execute it as a pre-parse plugin by creating a new metadata file. In
your `global` subgraph's metadata directory, create a new file named `allow-list.hml` and add the following
configuration.

```yaml
kind: LifecyclePluginHook
version: v1
definition:
  name: cloudflare allowlist
  url:
    valueFromEnv: ALLOW_LIST_URL
  pre: parse
  config:
    request:
      headers:
        additional:
          hasura-m-auth:
            valueFromEnv: M_AUTH_KEY
      session: {}
      rawRequest:
        query: {}
        variables: {}
```

:::info Using environment variables

We've used `valueFromEnv` so that we can dynamically and securely add values from our environment variables. You can add
these values to your root-level `.env` and then map them in the `globals` subgraph.yaml file. Alternatively, you can
include raw strings here using `value` instead of `valueFromEnv` and passing the keys.

:::

Next, update the `subgraph.yaml` file to include the metadata file and the environment variables.

```yaml
kind: Subgraph
version: v2
definition:
  name: globals
  ...
  includePaths:
    ...
    - allowlist-plugin.hml
  envMapping:
    ALLOW_LIST_URL:
      fromEnv: ALLOW_LIST_URL
    M_AUTH_KEY:
      fromEnv: M_AUTH_KEY
```

Finally, we need to add the environment variables to the `.env` file.

```bash
ALLOW_LIST_URL="http://local.hasura.dev:8787"
M_AUTH_KEY="your-strong-m-auth-key"
```

:::tip M-Auth Key

The `hasura-m-auth` header is a custom header that is used to authenticate the requests to the allowlist plugin. You can
use any strong key here to authenticate the plugin. DDN will automatically add this header to the requests to the
plugin. Also, make sure to update the `src/config.ts` file (in step 5) with the same key.

:::

## Step 4. Create a new build for local development

Create a new supergraph build.

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
```

Start the console for the local supergraph.

```bash
ddn console --local
```

You can now test the plugin by running queries or mutations that are not in the allowlist. The plugin will restrict
access to only the queries or mutations you've defined.

## Step 5. Update the plugin config

Update the `src/config.ts` file with the queries and mutations that you want to allow, using a strong m-auth key.

```typescript
export const Config = {
  headers: {
    "hasura-m-auth": "your-strong-m-auth-key",
  },
  allowlist: [
    ...,
    "query MyQuery {\n  getAuthorById(author_id: 10) {\n    first_name\n    id\n    last_name\n  }\n}",
  ],
};
```

:::info Hot reloading

The local wrangler development server will automatically reload the plugin when you make changes to the code.

:::

## Step 6. Configure the plugin variables

:::info Setup tracing

To enable tracing for the plugin, you need to update the `wrangler.toml` file with the required configurations. If you
don't want to enable tracing for the plugin, you can skip this step.

:::

In `allowlist-plugin` directory, update the `wrangler.toml` file with the required configurations.

```toml
...
[vars]
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "https://gateway.otlp.hasura.io:443/v1/traces"
OTEL_EXPORTER_PAT = "<PAT>"
```

Replace `<PAT>` with the Personal Access Token (PAT) for the Hasura Cloud account. You can generate this using the
`ddn auth print-pat` command.

## Step 7. Deploy the plugin

For your plugin to be reachable by your hosted supergraph, we'll need to deploy using Cloudflare Wrangler. The `deploy`
command included in your plugin's `package.json` will do this automatically for you and return the hosted service's URL.

**Note**: Please also update the `wrangler.toml` with your cloud PAT for the tracing to work.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will deploy the plugin to Cloudflare Workers and return the URL of the hosted service. Next, update the .env.cloud
file with the URL.

```bash
ALLOW_LIST_URL="https://<your-deployed-plugin>.workers.dev"
M_AUTH_KEY="your-strong-m-auth-key"
```

## Step 8. Create a new build

Create a new supergraph build.

```bash
ddn supergraph build create
```

The engine will execute the plugin before each request using the queries or mutations you defined.
