      <p>
        Hasura gives you the power to add HTTP hooks to different execution steps of your supergraph. This allows you to
        extend the capabilities of your API by adding custom logic executed in response to events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engine plugins allow you to execute this logic either before or after the execution of a query or a mutation. This gives you the power to add custom logic driven by user-defined events on your API.
