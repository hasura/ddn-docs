# Caching Plugin

## Introduction

The [Caching Plugin](https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-caching) allows you to cache responses for specific GraphQL
queries, enhancing performance by reducing repeated computation for frequently executed queries.

The plugin integrates with Hasura DDN as both a **pre-parse plugin** and **pre-response plugin**. It uses Redis as the
caching backend, ensuring fast and reliable storage for cached query results.

Key benefits of the caching plugin include:

- **Improved performance:** Reduces load on your supergraph by caching frequently executed queries.
- **Customizable caching:** Define specific queries to cache and configure cache lifetimes.
- **Integration-ready:** Compatible with Hasura's lifecycle plugin hooks and OpenTelemetry for tracing.

## Next steps

To configure and deploy the Caching Plugin, refer to the [guide](/plugins/caching/how-to.mdx), which provides detailed
steps for setting up the plugin in a local or production environment.
