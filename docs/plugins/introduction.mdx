# Introduction

Hasura allows you to add HTTP hooks at various stages of the engine's execution. This enables you to enhance DDN by
adding custom functionalities through your own code.

These plugins can be applied at the following steps:

| Execution Step   | Description                                                                                                                                          | Example Usage                                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-Parse**    | The first step in the execution pipeline, where custom logic can be applied before the query is parsed and its internal representation is generated. | Add an allowlist layer to restrict access to specific queries and mutations. |
| **Pre-Response** | The final step in the execution pipeline, where custom logic can be added after the query is executed but before the response is sent to the client. | Trigger Slack notifications after a mutation is executed.                    |

## Architecture

<Thumbnail src="/img/plugins/architecture.jpg" alt="Engine architecture with plugins" width="1000px" />

Engine plugins are HTTP servers that run alongside DDN and can be written in any language capable of running an HTTP
server. They are configured in DDN using DDN metadata. The engine sends HTTP requests to the plugin at the specified
execution step, the plugin processes the request, and then sends a response back to the engine, which continues
execution based on the plugin's response.

## Plugin Configuration

Engine plugins are configured in DDN using metadata. The metadata specifies the URL of the engine plugin and the
execution step at which the plugin should be called. The configuration also can control the request that is sent to the
engine plugin.

Here is an example of a plugin configuration in DDN metadata:

```yaml
kind: LifecyclePluginHook
version: v1
definition:
  name: cloudflare allowlist
  url:
    valueFromEnv: ALLOW_LIST_URL
  pre: parse
  config:
    request:
      headers:
        additional:
          hasura-m-auth:
            value: "your-strong-m-auth-key"
      session: {}
      rawRequest:
        query: {}
        variables: {}
```

In this example, the plugin is configured to run at the `pre-parse` execution step. The plugin is called
`cloudflare allowlist`. The URL of the plugin is read from the `ALLOW_LIST_URL` environment variable. The plugin is
configured to add a `hasura-m-auth` header to the request with the value `your-strong-m-auth-key`.

Also, the request that is sent to the plugin is configured to have the query and variables from the incoming GraphQL
request. It is also configured to have the session information from the incoming request.

## Pre-Parse Plugin

The `pre-parse` plugin is triggered at the first step in the execution pipeline, before the query is parsed. Use this
step to add custom logic before parsing begins.

For pre-parse plugin configuration
[click here](supergraph-modeling/engine-plugins.mdx#lifecyclepluginhook-lifecyclepreparsepluginhook).

### Pre-Parse Plugin Request

A sample request that is sent to the `pre-parse` plugin is as follows:

```json
{
  "rawRequest": {
    "query": "query MyQuery { getAuthorById(author_id: 10) { first_name } }",
    "variables": {},
    "operationName": "MyQuery"
  },
  "session": {
    "role": "user",
    "variables": {
      "x-hasura-role": "user",
      "x-hasura-user-id": "123"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: The request sent to the plugin can be customized based on the plugin's
[configuration](supergraph-modeling/engine-plugins.mdx#lifecyclepluginhook-lifecyclepreresponsepluginhookconfigrequest).

### Pre-Parse Plugin Response

The `pre-parse` plugin can control the execution pipeline by returning a response to DDN. The response can be one of the
following:

| Response Type    | HTTP Status Code | Response Body | Description                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Continue`       | `204`            | -             | Continue with the execution.                                |
| `Response`       | `200`            | Response body | Stop the execution and return the response to the client.   |
| `User Error`     | `400`            | Error object  | Stop the execution and return the error to the client.      |
| `Internal Error` | `500`            | Error object  | Stop the execution and return internal error to the client. |

:::warning Response Validation

The response from the plugin is not validated by DDN. It is the responsibility of the plugin to return a valid response
based on the plugin's logic.

:::

### Use Cases

The `pre-parse` plugin can be used to add a multitude of functionalities to DDN. Some use cases are:

- **Allowlist**: Add an allowlist layer to restrict access to specific queries and mutations based on the incoming
  request and session information.
- **Basic Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to restrict the total number of requests that can be made to DDN in a
  given time period.
- **Custom Query Validation**: Add custom query validation logic to ensure that the incoming query is valid based on
  custom business logic.
- **Cache Get**: Implement a cache get layer to fetch the response from the cache before executing the query.

### Multiple Pre-Parse Plugins

Multiple pre-parse plugins can be configured in DDN metadata. The plugins are executed in the order they are defined in
the metadata.

Please note that if a plugin returns a `Response`, `User Error` or `Internal Error` response, the execution stops and
the response is sent to the client. The subsequent plugins are not executed.

Let's take an example where the engine is confiured with two pre-parse plugins: `Pre-parse hook 1` and
`Pre-parse hook 2`.

<Thumbnail src="/img/plugins/multiple-pre-parse-plugins.jpg" alt="Multiple pre-parse plugins" width="750px" />

In this example, the engine is configured with two pre-parse plugins. The engine sends the request to
`Pre-parse hook 1`, which processes the request and sends a response. Now, depending on the response, the engine either
continues with the execution or stops and sends the response to the client.

#### Case 1: Continue

If `Pre-parse hook 1` returns a `Continue` response (HTTP status code is 204), the engine sends the request to
`Pre-parse hook 2`. The engine continues this process until all the pre-parse plugins are executed.

:::tip Continue response body

The `Continue` response body is ignored by DDN. The plugin can return an empty response body.

:::

#### Case 2: Response/ User Error/ Internal Error

If `Pre-parse hook 1` returns a `Response` response (HTTP status code is 200) or a `User Error` response (HTTP status
code is 400) or an `Internal Error` response (HTTP status code is 500), the engine stops the execution and sends the
response to the client. The subsequent `pre-parse` plugins are not executed.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/plugins/multiple-pre-parse-plugins-p1-response.jpg"
  alt="Multiple pre-parse plugins with 1st plugin
response being sent to the client"
  width="750px"
/>

:::note Will the subsequent pre-response plugins be executed?

Yes, the subsequent `pre-response` plugins are executed even if the `pre-parse` plugins return a `Response`, `User Error` or
`Internal Error` response.

:::

If all the pre-parse plugins return a `Continue` response (HTTP status code 204), the engine continues with the
execution and sends the response generated by the engine to the client.

:::note Can pre-parse plugins change the request?

No, pre-parse plugins cannot modify the request in the execution pipeline. The plugins can only control the execution
pipeline by returning appropriate responses.

:::

## Pre-Response Plugin

The `pre-response` plugin is triggered at the final step in the execution pipeline after the query is executed. Use
this step to add webhooks after the query is executed. Please note that the `pre-response` plugin cannot control or
change the execution pipeline.

For pre-response plugin configuration
[click here](supergraph-modeling/engine-plugins.mdx#lifecyclepluginhook-lifecyclepreresponsepluginhook).

### Pre-Response Plugin Request

A sample request that is sent to the `pre-response` plugin is as follows:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "data": {
      "getAuthorById": {
        "first_name": "John"
      }
    }
  },
  "session": {
    "role": "user",
    "variables": {
      "x-hasura-role": "user",
      "x-hasura-user-id": "123"
    }
  },
  "rawRequest": {
    "query": "query MyQuery { getAuthorById(author_id: 10) { first_name } }",
    "variables": {},
    "operationName": "MyQuery"
  }
}
```

**Note**: The request sent to the plugin can be customized based on the plugin's
[configuration](supergraph-modeling/engine-plugins.mdx#lifecyclepluginhook-lifecyclepreresponsepluginhookconfigrequest).

### Pre-Response Plugin Response

The `pre-response` plugin cannot control the execution pipeline. The response from the plugin is ignored by DDN.

### Use Cases

The `pre-response` plugin can be used to add a number of functionalities to DDN. Some use cases also make use of
the pre-parse plugin. They are:

- **Slack Notifications**: Trigger Slack notifications after a query/mutation is executed.
- **Cache Set**: Implement a cache set layer to store the response in the cache.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Implement a cache invalidation layer to invalidate the cache based on the incoming request
  and session information.
- **Audit Logs**: Add audit logs to track the queries and mutations executed by the users.

### Multiple Pre-Response Plugins

Multiple `pre-response` plugins can be configured in DDN metadata. The plugins are executed in parallel.

Let's take an example where the engine is configured with two `pre-response` plugins: `Pre-response hook 1` and
`Pre-response hook 2`.

<Thumbnail src="/img/plugins/multiple-pre-response-plugins.jpg" alt="Multiple pre-response plugins" width="750px" />

In this example, the engine is configured with two `pre-response` plugins. The engine sends the request to both the
plugins in parallel. The engine does not wait for the response from the plugins and sends the response generated by the
engine to the client.
