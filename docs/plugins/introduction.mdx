# Introduction

Hasura allows you to add HTTP hooks at various stages of the engine's execution. This enables you to enhance DDN by
adding custom functionalities through your own code.

These plugins can be applied at the following steps:

| Execution Step              | Description                                                                                                                                          | Example Usage                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-Parse**               | The first step in the execution pipeline, where custom logic can be applied before the query is parsed and its internal representation is generated. | Add an allowlist layer to restrict access to specific queries and mutations. |
| **Pre-Response (Upcoming)** | The final step in the execution pipeline, where custom logic can be added after the query is executed but before the response is sent to the client. | Trigger Slack notifications after a mutation is executed.                    |

## Architecture

<Thumbnail src="/img/plugins/architecture.jpg" alt="Adminer" width="1000px" />

Engine plugins are HTTP servers that run alongside DDN and can be written in any language capable of running an HTTP
server. They are configured in DDN using DDN metadata. The engine sends HTTP requests to the plugin at the specified
execution step, the plugin processes the request, and then sends a response back to the engine, which continues
execution based on the plugin's response.

## Plugin Configuration

Engine plugins are configured in DDN using metadata. The metadata specifies the URL of the engine plugin and the
execution step at which the plugin should be called. The configuration also can control the request that is sent to the
engine plugin.

Here is an example of a plugin configuration in DDN metadata:

```yaml
kind: LifecyclePluginHook
version: v1
definition:
  name: cloudflare allowlist
  url:
    valueFromEnv: ALLOW_LIST_URL
  pre: parse
  config:
    request:
    headers:
      additional:
        hasura-m-auth:
          value: "your-strong-m-auth-key"
    session: {}
    rawRequest:
      query: {}
      variables: {}
```

In this example, the plugin is configured to run at the `pre-parse` execution step. The plugin is called
`cloudflare allowlist`. The URL of the plugin is read from the `ALLOW_LIST_URL` environment variable. The plugin is
configured to add a `hasura-m-auth` header to the request with the value `your-strong-m-auth-key`.

Also, the request that is sent to the plugin is configured to have the query and variables from the incoming GraphQL
request. It is also configured to have the session information from the incoming request.

## Pre-Parse Plugin

The `pre-parse` plugin is triggered at the first step in the execution pipeline, before the query is parsed. Use this
step to add custom logic before parsing begins.

### Pre-Parse Plugin Request

A sample request that is sent to the `pre-parse` plugin is as follows:

```json
{
  "rawRequest": {
    "query": "query MyQuery { getAuthorById(author_id: 10) { first_name } }",
    "variables": {},
    "operationName": "MyQuery"
  },
  "session": {
    "role": "user",
    "variables": {
      "x-hasura-role": "user",
      "x-hasura-user-id": "123"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: The request sent to the plugin can be customized based on the plugin's
[configuration](supergraph-modeling/engine-plugins.mdx#lifecyclepluginhook-lifecyclepluginhookconfigrequest).

### Pre-Parse Plugin Response

The `pre-parse` plugin can control the execution pipeline by returning a response to DDN. The response can be one of the
following:

| Response Type    | HTTP Status Code | Response Body | Description                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Continue`       | `204`            | -             | Continue with the execution.                                |
| `Response`       | `200`            | Response body | Stop the execution and return the response to the client.   |
| `User Error`     | `400`            | Error object  | Stop the execution and return the error to the client.      |
| `Internal Error` | `500`            | Error object  | Stop the execution and return internal error to the client. |

### Multiple Pre-Parse Plugins

Multiple pre-parse plugins can be configured in DDN metadata. The plugins are executed in the order they are defined in
the metadata.

Please note that if a plugin returns a `Response`, `User Error` or `Internal Error` response, the execution stops and
the response is sent to the client. The subsequent plugins are not executed.

:::info Response Validation

The response from the plugin is not validated by DDN. It is the responsibility of the plugin to return a valid response
based on the plugin's logic.
