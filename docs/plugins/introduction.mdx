# Introduction

Hasura gives you the power to add HTTP hooks to different execution steps of the
DDN. This allows you to add new functionalities on top of the Hasura DDN by
writing custom code that runs at different stages of the execution.

Engine plugins are a way to extend the capabilities of the Hasura DDN by adding
custom logic to different execution steps. Engine plugins can be used at the following
execution steps:

- **Pre-Parse**: This is the first step in the execution pipeline. You can use
  this step to add custom logic before the query is parsed. For example, you can
  use this step to add an allowlist layer on top of your DDN to restrict access
  to only specific queries and mutations.
- **Pre-Response (Upcoming)**: This is the last step in the execution pipeline.
  You can use this step to add custom logic after the query is executed but
  before the response is sent back to the client. For example, you can use this
  step to add some Slack notifications after a mutation is executed.

Engine plugins are HTTP servers that run alongside the Hasura DDN. They can be
written in any language that can run an HTTP server. Engine plugins are
configured in the DDN using OpenDD metadata. The DDN sends HTTP requests to the
engine plugin at the configured execution step. The engine plugin processes the
request and sends a response back to the DDN. The DDN then continues with the
execution based on the response from the engine plugin.

## Plugin Configuration

Engine plugins are configured in the DDN using OpenDD metadata. The metadata
specifies the URL of the engine plugin and the execution step at which the
plugin should be called. The configuration also can control the request that is
sent to the engine plugin.

Here is an example of a plugin configuration in OpenDD metadata:

```yaml
kind: LifecyclePluginHook
version: v1
definition:
name: cloudflare allow list
url:
  valueFromEnv: ALLOW_LIST_URL
pre: parse
config:
  request:
  headers:
    additional:
    hasura-m-auth:
      value: "your-strong-m-auth-key"
  session: {}
  rawRequest:
    query: {}
    variables: {}
```

In this example, the plugin is configured to run at the `pre-parse` execution step.
The plugin is called `cloudflare allow list`. The URL of the plugin is read from
the `ALLOW_LIST_URL` environment variable. The plugin is configured to add a
`hasura-m-auth` header to the request with the value `your-strong-m-auth-key`.

Also, the request that is sent to the plugin is configured to have the query and
variables from the incoming GraphQL request. It is also configured to have the
session information from the incoming request.

## Pre-Parse Plugin

The `pre-parse` plugin is called before the query is parsed. This is the first
step in the execution pipeline. You can use this step to add custom logic before
the query is parsed.

The `pre-parse` plugin can control the execution pipeline by returning a response
to the DDN. The response can be one of the following:

| Response Type    | HTTP Status Code | Response Body | Description                                                |
|------------------|------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Continue`       | 204              | -             | Continue with the execution                                |
| `User Error`     | 400              | Error object  | Stop the execution and return the error to the client      |
| `Internal Error` | 500              | Error object  | Stop the execution and return internal error to the client |
