# Rate Limit Plugin

## Introduction

The [Rate Limit Plugin](https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-rate-limit) allows you to add rate limiting to your
supergraph, ensuring that the supergraph is not overloaded with requests. This can be useful for preventing abuse or
denial-of-service attacks.

The plugin integrates with Hasura DDN as a **pre-parse plugin**. It uses Redis for keeping track of the number of
requests made to the supergraph.

Key benefits of the rate limit plugin include:

- **Enhanced security:** Prevent abuse or denial-of-service attacks.
- **Flexibility:** Supports dynamic configuration including using roles, headers (can be used for IP-based rate
  limiting) and session variables.
- **Integration:** Works as a pre-parse plugin, ensuring easy integration with Hasura DDN.

## Next steps

To get started with configuring and deploying the Rate Limit Plugin, refer to the
[guide](/plugins/rate-limit/how-to.mdx), which walks you through the process of setting up, configuring, and deploying
the plugin.
