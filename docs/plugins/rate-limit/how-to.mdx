# How to Configure the Rate Limit Plugin

## Introduction

The [Rate Limit Plugin](https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-rate-limit) adds the ability to limit the number of
requests that can be made to DDN in a given time period.

## Setting up for local development

Add the following services to your root-level `compose.yaml` file (this is the one located at
`<project-root>/compose.yaml`). Add these new services at the same level as your existing `services` entries:

```yaml
redis:
  image: redis:latest
  ports:
    - 6379:6379

rate-limit:
  build:
    context: https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-rate-limit.git
  ports:
    - "3001:3001"
  environment:
    - PORT=3001
    - DEBUG=rate-limit*
    - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://gateway.otlp.hasura.io:443/v1/traces
    - OTEL_EXPORTER_PAT=your-pat-here
    - HASURA_DDN_PLUGIN_CONFIG_PATH=plugin_config
  depends_on:
    redis:
      condition: service_healthy
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3001/health"]
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 3
  volumes:
    - ./rate_limit_config:/app/plugin_config
```

Here, we've added a Redis instance to our Docker Compose project, as well as an instance of the Rate Limit Plugin. The
Rate Limit Plugin expects a config directory (which we've said here is saved in `./rate_limit_config`, though the path
is up to you). Here's an example config directory:

```
rate_limit_config/
├── configuration.json
└── rate-limit.json
```

The `configuration.json` file is used to configure the plugin, and the `rate-limit.json` file is used to configure the
rate limit.

The `configuration.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "hasura-m-auth": "your-auth-token"
  }
}
```

Please replace `your-auth-token` with a strong, random string.

The `rate-limit.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "redis_url": "redis://redis:6379",
  "rate_limit": {
    "default_limit": 10,
    "time_window": 60,
    "excluded_roles": [],
    "key_config": {
      "from_headers": [],
      "from_session_variables": [],
      "from_role": true
    },
    "unavailable_behavior": {
      "fallback_mode": "deny"
    },
    "role_based_limits": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "limit": 11
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The rate limiting configuration includes:

- `redis_url`: Redis connection URL
- `rate_limit`: Rate limiting configuration. The rate limiting can be configured using the following parameters:
  - `default_limit`: The default rate limit per window
  - `time_window`: The time window in seconds
  - `excluded_roles`: Roles that are excluded from rate limiting
  - `key_config`: Configuration for generating rate limit keys:
    - `from_headers`: Headers to include in the rate limit key (if header is not found in the request, it is skipped)
    - `from_session_variables`: Session variables to include in the rate limit key (if variable is not found in the
      request, it is skipped)
    - `from_role`: Whether to include the role in the rate limit key
  - `unavailable_behavior`: Behavior when Redis is unavailable
  - `role_based_limits`: Role-based rate limits (this takes precedence over the default limit)

## Adding the plugin to your project

Once we've configured the plugin, running `ddn run docker-start` will start it and its necessary services along with our
engine and any connectors. Now, we just need to configure Hasura to use the plugin. Add a new metadata file (say
`rate-limit.hml`) to your `globals` subgraph's metadata directory:

```yaml
kind: LifecyclePluginHook
version: v1
definition:
  pre: parse
  name: rate-limit
  url:
    valueFromEnv: RATE_LIMIT_PLUGIN_URL
  config:
    request:
      headers:
        additional:
          hasura-m-auth:
            valueFromEnv: RATE_LIMIT_PLUGIN_AUTH_TOKEN
      session: {}
      rawRequest:
        query: {}
        variables: {}
```

:::info Using environment variables

We've used `valueFromEnv` so that we can dynamically and securely add values from our environment variables. You can add
these values to your root-level `.env` and then map them in the `globals` subgraph.yaml file. Alternatively, you can
include raw strings here using `value` instead of `valueFromEnv` and passing the keys.

For local development, `RATE_LIMIT_PLUGIN_URL` should be `http://local.hasura.dev:3001/rate-limit`, and
`RATE_LIMIT_PLUGIN_AUTH_TOKEN` should be the value you set in the `configuration.json` file.

:::

## Running the project

At this point, we can create a build of our project and start local development:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
ddn run docker-start
```

You can now test the plugin by making requests to your supergraph. You should see the plugin enforce the rate limit
you've configured (10 requests per minute for all other roles and 11 requests per minute for the `user` role).

## Deploying the plugin

The plugin can be deployed as a regular HTTP service, anywhere an Express server can be deployed. When deployed, make
sure to set the `RATE_LIMIT_PLUGIN_URL` and `RATE_LIMIT_PLUGIN_AUTH_TOKEN` to appropriate values in `.cloud.env`. Note
that the plugin must be visible from your Hasura deployment: if you are hosting for the Hasura Cloud, the plugin must be
publicly visible.

:::info Your plugin must be reachable

Since the rate limit plugin is a pre-parse plugin, it must be reachable from the Hasura deployment. If you are hosting
for the Hasura Cloud, the plugin must be publicly visible.
