# RESTified Endpoints Plugin

The [RESTified Endpoints Plugin](https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-restified-endpoint) allows you to add RESTified
GraphQL endpoints to DDN. This can be used to add custom REST endpoints to DDN that would execute specified GraphQL
query on the DDN GraphQL API and return the response.

The plugin integrates with Hasura DDN as a **pre-route plugin** and can be deployed as an HTTP service using tools like
Cloudflare Workers or similar services.

Key benefits of using the RESTified Endpoints Plugin include:

- **Simplified API Design**: The plugin enables you to design and expose your GraphQL API as RESTful endpoints, making
  it easier for clients to interact with your API using familiar HTTP methods and conventions.
- **Flexibility**: You can define custom REST endpoints that correspond to specific GraphQL queries, allowing you to
  tailor your API to the needs of your clients.
- **Easy Integration**: The plugin seamlessly integrates with Hasura DDN, ensuring that your RESTified endpoints are
  well-integrated with your existing GraphQL API, providing a single, unified interface for your clients.

## Next steps
