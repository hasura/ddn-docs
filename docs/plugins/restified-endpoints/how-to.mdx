# How to Configure the RESTified Endpoints Plugin

## Introduction

The [RESTified GraphQL endpoints plugin](https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-restified-endpoint) allows you to add
RESTified GraphQL endpoints to DDN. This can be used to add custom REST endpoints to DDN that would execute specified
GraphQL query on the DDN GraphQL API and return the response.

This guide provides a step-by-step guide on how to configure and deploy the RESTified Endpoints Plugin for Hasura DDN
using either of the two methods:

1. [Using docker image](#using-docker-image)
2. [Using Cloudflare Wrangler](#using-cloudflare-wrangler)

## Using Docker Image

In this example, we're going to use a Docker image to configure the RESTified Endpoints Plugin for Hasura DDN. You can
use similar configurations to deploy the plugin using kubernetes or any other container orchestration tool.

### Step 1. Set up plugin for local development

Add the following service to your root-level `docker-compose.yaml` file (this is the one located at
`<project-root>/docker-compose.yaml`). Add this new service at the same level as your existing `services` entries:

```yaml
restified-endpoints:
  build:
    context: https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-restified-endpoint.git
  ports:
    - 8787:8787
  environment:
    - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://gateway.otlp.hasura.io:443/v1/traces
    - OTEL_EXPORTER_PAT=your-pat-here
    - GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL=http://engine:3000
    - HASURA_DDN_PLUGIN_CONFIG_PATH=plugin_config
  volumes:
    - ./restified-endpoints-config:/app/plugin_config
```

Here, we're building the image from the `engine-plugin-restified-endpoint` repository. We're also forwarding the
`plugin_config` directory to the container. This directory will contain the configuration for the plugin. Here is the
structure of the `plugin_config` directory:

```
plugin_config/
└── configuration.json
```

The `configuration.json` file is used to configure the plugin. Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  "graphqlServer": {
    "headers": {
      "additional": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      "forward": ["X-Hasura-Role", "Authorization", "X-Hasura-ddn-token"]
    }
  },
  "headers": {
    "hasura-m-auth": "zZkhKqFjqXR4g5MZCsJUZCnhCcoPyZ"
  },
  "restifiedEndpoints": [
    {
      "path": "/v1/api/rest/artistbyname/:name",
      "methods": ["GET", "POST"],
      "query": "query artistByName($name: String!) { artist(where: {name: {_eq: $name}}) { name }}"
    },
    {
      "path": "/v1/api/rest/artists",
      "methods": ["GET", "POST"],
      "query": "query artists($limit: Int = 10, $offset: Int = 0) { artist(limit: $limit, offset: $offset) { name } }"
    }
  ]
}
```

The RESTified endpoints configuration includes:

- `graphqlServer`: Configuration for the GraphQL server:
  - `headers`: Configuration for the headers to be sent to the GraphQL server:
    - `additional`: Additional headers to be sent to the GraphQL server.
    - `forward`: Headers to be forwarded from the request to the GraphQL server.
- `headers.hasura-m-auth`: The `hasura-m-auth` header is a custom header that is used to authenticate the requests to
  the plugin. You can use any strong key here to authenticate the plugin. DDN will automatically add this header to the
  requests to the plugin.
- `restifiedEndpoints`: Configuration for the RESTified endpoints. Each endpoint includes:
  - `path`: The path of the endpoint (this can include path parameters like `:name`, which is used in the query as
    variables)
  - `methods`: The HTTP methods supported by the endpoint.
  - `query`: The GraphQL query to be executed when the endpoint is called.

### Step 2. Add the plugin configuration

We'll let the engine know about the plugin and to execute it as a pre-route plugin by creating a new metadata file. In
your `global` subgraph's metadata directory, create a new file named `restified-endpoints.hml` and add the following
configuration.

```yaml
kind: LifecyclePluginHook
version: v1
definition:
  pre: route
  name: restified_endpoints
  url:
    valueFromEnv: RESTIFIED_ENDPOINTS_URL
  config:
    matchPath: "/v1/api/rest/*"
    matchMethods: ["GET", "POST"]
    request:
      method: GET
      headers:
        forward:
          - Authorization
          - x-hasura-role
          - x-hasura-ddn-token
        additional:
          hasura-m-auth:
            valueFromEnv: M_AUTH_KEY
      rawRequest:
        path: {}
        query: {}
        method: {}
        body: {}
    response:
      headers:
        additional:
          content-type:
            value: application/json
```

:::tip URL Match

The `matchPath` field is used to match the regex to the request path, while `matchMethods` specifies the HTTP methods to
match. In this example, we're matching all `GET` and `POST` requests to `/v1/api/rest/*`. You can modify these to match
any path and methods (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) you wish.

Also, note that we can not use the pre-defined DDN endpoints (like `/graphql`, `/v1/sql`, `/v1/jsonapi`, `/v1/explain`,
`/healthz` and `/metrics`) in the `matchPath` field.

Moreover, on DDN cloud, for security reasons, only the `/v1/api/rest/*` path is allowed for the pre-route plugin.

:::

:::info Using environment variables

We've used `valueFromEnv` so that we can dynamically and securely add values from our environment variables. You can add
these values to your root-level `.env` and then map them in the `globals` subgraph.yaml file. Alternatively, you can
include raw strings here using `value` instead of `valueFromEnv` and passing the keys.

:::

Next, update the `subgraph.yaml` file to include the environment variables.

```yaml
kind: Subgraph
version: v2
definition:
  name: globals
  ...
  includePaths:
    ...
  envMapping:
    RESTIFIED_ENDPOINTS_URL:
      fromEnv: RESTIFIED_ENDPOINTS_URL
    M_AUTH_KEY:
      fromEnv: M_AUTH_KEY
```

Finally, we need to add the environment variables to the `.env` file.

```bash
RESTIFIED_ENDPOINTS_URL="http://local.hasura.dev:8787"
M_AUTH_KEY="your-strong-m-auth-key"
```

:::tip M-Auth Key

The `hasura-m-auth` header is a custom header that is used to authenticate the requests to the allowlist plugin. You can
use any strong key here to authenticate the plugin. DDN will automatically add this header to the requests to the
plugin. Also, make sure to update the `src/config.ts` file (in step 5) with the same key.

:::

### Step 3. Run everything

At this point, you can run the following command to build and start local development:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
ddn run docker-start
```

You can now test the plugin by making a request to the RESTified GraphQL endpoints defined in the plugin's
configuration.

If you want to make changes to the plugin configuration, you can update the `configuration.json` file and restart the
docker services.

### Step 4. Deploy the plugin

The plugin can be deployed as a regular HTTP service using any container orchestration tool. When deployed, make sure to
set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_PAT`, `GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL` and `HASURA_DDN_PLUGIN_CONFIG_PATH` to
appropriate values in `.cloud.env`. Note that the plugin must be visible from your Hasura deployment: if you are hosting
for the Hasura Cloud, the plugin must be publicly visible.

:::info Your plugin must be reachable

Since the rate limit plugin is a pre-parse plugin, it must be reachable from the Hasura deployment. If you are hosting
for the Hasura Cloud, the plugin must be publicly visible.

:::

## Using Cloudflare Wrangler

In this example, we're using Cloudflare Wrangler to deploy our plugin as a Cloudflare Worker. You can get started with
Wrangler [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

### Step 1. Create a new plugin project

Create a new Cloudflare Worker project using the `create-cloudflare` command with the
[`restified-endpoints` plugin template](https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-restified-endpoint):

```bash
npx create-cloudflare@latest restified-endpoints-plugin --template https://github.com/hasura/engine-plugin-restified-endpoint
```

This will create a new project with the required files and dependencies.

### Step 2. Install dependencies

Navigate to the new directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd restified-endpoints-plugin
npm install
```

Start the local development server.

```bash
npm start
```

### Step 3. Add the plugin configuration

Follow the steps in the [docker image plugin configuration](#step-2-add-the-plugin-configuration) section to add the
plugin configuration.

### Step 4. Create a new build for local development

Create a new supergraph build.

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
```

Start the console for the local supergraph.

```bash
ddn console --local
```

You can now test the plugin by making a request to the RESTified GraphQL endpoints defined in the plugin's
configuration.

### Step 5. Update the plugin config

Update the `src/config.ts` file with the RESTified GraphQL endpoints that you want to add.

```typescript
export const Config = {
  graphqlServer: {
    headers: {
      additional: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      // Please make sure to forward the authentication headers here
      forward: ["hasura_cloud_pat", "x-hasura-ddn-token"],
    },
  },
  headers: {
    "hasura-m-auth": "your-strong-m-auth-key",
  },
  restifiedEndpoints: [
    ...,
    {
      path: "/v1/api/rest/users",
      methods: ["GET", "POST"],
      query: `
        query MyQuery($limit: Int = 10, $offset: Int = 0) {
          Users(limit: $limit, offset: $offset) {
            Name
          }
        }
      `,
    }
  ],
};
```

:::info Hot reloading

The local wrangler development server will automatically reload the plugin when you make changes to the code.

:::

### Step 6. Configure the plugin variables

:::info Setup tracing

To enable tracing for the plugin, you need to update the `wrangler.toml` file with the required configurations. If you
don't want to enable tracing for the plugin, you can skip this step.

:::

In `restified-endpoints-plugin` directory, update the `wrangler.toml` file with the required configurations.

```toml
...
[vars]
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "https://gateway.otlp.hasura.io:443/v1/traces"
OTEL_EXPORTER_PAT = "<PAT>"
GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL = "<DDN_GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL>"
```

Replace `<PAT>` with the Personal Access Token (PAT) for the Hasura Cloud account. You can display this using the
`ddn auth print-access-token` command.

Replace `<DDN_GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL>` with the URL of your DDN GraphQL server. You can find this in the DDN console under
the `Settings > Project Summary` section.

### Step 7. Deploy the plugin

For your plugin to be reachable by your hosted supergraph, we can deploy with any service that hosts HTTPS services.
Here we will use Cloudflare Wrangler to deploy the plugin. The `deploy` command included in your plugin's `package.json`
will do this automatically for you and return the hosted service's URL.

**Note**: Please also update the `wrangler.toml` with your cloud PAT for the tracing to work.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will deploy the plugin to Cloudflare Workers and return the URL of the hosted service. Next, update the .env.cloud
file with the URL.

```bash
RESTIFIED_ENDPOINTS_URL="https://<your-deployed-plugin>.workers.dev"
M_AUTH_KEY="your-strong-m-auth-key"
```

### Step 8. Create a new build

Create a new supergraph build on Hasura DDN to check your work in the cloud.

```bash
ddn supergraph build create
```

:::info Cloud project required

In order for this command to succeed, you'll need a cloud project paired with your local metadata. If you don't already
have one, you can create one using the CLI.

```sh title="From the root of the project directory, run:"
ddn project init .
```

:::

### Step 9. Apply the build

Apply the build to make it the default one served by your Hasura DDN project endpoint. You can do this from the DDN
console by choosing the build from the `Builds` tab and clicking `Apply Build`.

The engine will execute the plugin for each requests to the RESTified GraphQL endpoints you defined.

```sh title="As in the earlier example, you can test this by navigating to the endpoint for any paths you've set up in your plugin's configuration:"
# E.g., https://profound-applet-5420.ddn.hasura.app/v1/api/rest/users
https://<your_Hasura_DDN_project_url_excluding_graphql>/v1/api/rest/<endpoint_path>
```
