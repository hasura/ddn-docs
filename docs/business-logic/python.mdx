# Custom Business Logic via Python

## Introduction

The [Python Lambda Connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-python-lambda) can be added to any project to incorporate
custom business logic directly into your supergraph.

This can be used to enrich data returned to clients, or to write custom mutations in Python.

:::info Prerequisites

If you've never used Hasura DDN, we recommend that you first go through the
[getting started](/how-to-build-with-ddn/overview.mdx). 😊

:::

## Functions or Procedures

Python functions exported from a file in the [Python Lambda Connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-python-lambda) will
then be available from your Hasura DDN GraphQL API in the form of either **functions** or **procedures**.

In Hasura metadata, **functions** are used for read operations. They will not modify the data in the database and can
only be used to retrieve data.

Conversely, **procedures** are used for write operations. They can modify the data in the database and can be used to
create, update, or delete data.

The distinction is important in metadata because it allows the system to know what types to expect for arguments and
return values.

## Add the Python connector to a project

### Step 1. Initialize the Python Lambda connector

Let's begin by initializing the connector on our project. In the example below, you'll see a familiar flow and use the
`hasura/python` connector from the connector hub.

```bash title="Run the following command:"
ddn connector init my_python -i
```

- Select `hasura/python` from the list of connectors.
- Choose a port (press enter to accept the default recommended by the CLI).
- In this example, we've called the connector `my_python`. You can name it something descriptive.

#### What did this do?

This command created the following file structure in a `my_subgraph/connector/my_python` directory, with the
`functions.py` file being your connector's entrypoint:

```bash
.
├── .ddnignore
├── .env.cloud
├── .env.local
├── .gitignore
├── .hasura-connector
│  ├── ...
├── compose.yaml
├── connector.cloud.yaml
├── connector.local.yaml
# highlight-start
├── functions.py
# highlight-end
└── requirements.txt
```

### Step 2. Write business logic

The template code that ships with the Python Lambda connector provides some simple examples to help explain how it
works. We can replace those example functions for now.

In this simple example, we're going to transform a timestamp with timezone (eg: "2024-03-14T08:00:00Z") into a nicely
formatted version for humans, eg: "8am, Thursday, March 14th, 2024."

We'll replace the all the default functions in our `functions.py` file with the following:

```python
from hasura_ndc import start
from hasura_ndc.function_connector import FunctionConnector
from datetime import datetime # Don't forget to import datetime at the top of the file!

connector = FunctionConnector()

@connector.register_query
async def format_timezone_date(date_string: str) -> str:
    date = datetime.fromisoformat(date_string)

    day = date.day
    nth = lambda d: "th" if 11 <= d <= 13 else {1: "st", 2: "nd", 3: "rd"}.get(d % 10, "th")

    hours = date.hour
    ampm = "pm" if hours >= 12 else "am"
    hour = hours % 12 or 12

    day_of_week = date.strftime("%A")
    month = date.strftime("%B")
    year = date.year

    return f"{hour}{ampm}, {day_of_week}, {month} {day}{nth(day)}, {year}."


if __name__ == "__main__":
    start(connector)
```

As this is a Python project, you can install any dependency!

### Step 3. Track the new function

To add our function, we can use the following to generate the related metadata that will link together any functions in
this `functions.py` file and our API.

```bash
ddn connector introspect my_python
ddn command add my_python "*"
```

### Step 4. Create a new API build and test

Next, let's create a new build of our supergraph:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
```

:::tip Start your engines!

Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine using the following command.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn run docker-start
```

This reads the `docker-start` script from the context config at `.hasura/context.yaml` and starts your Hasura engine,
any connectors, and observability tools.

:::

You should see your command available, along with its documentation, in the GraphiQL explorer on the console which you
should be able to access using:

```bash title="Run:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title=" You can then test your new command with the following query:"
query MyQuery {
  formatTimezoneDate(dateString: "2024-03-14")
}
```

:::tip Privacy settings in some browsers

Your browser settings or privacy tools may prevent the Console from accessing your local Hasura instance. This could be
due to features designed to protect your privacy and security. Should you encounter one of these issues, we recommend
disabling these settings for the `console.hasura.io` domain.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) are the recommended
browsers for the best experience with the Hasura Console including for local development.

:::

:::note Running Python locally

By default, Python and your functions run in a Docker container along with your other Hasura services. The
`connector init` command created a `compose.yaml` file for you, which are used by default.

However, if you prefer to run Python directly on your local machine, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version `>=3.11` installed on your machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash title="Change to the connector directory and install dependencies:"
cd my_subgraph/connector/my_python && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. From the `my_python` directory, run this command to load environment variables from your project's `.env` file, start
   the connector, and watch for any changes:

On Mac or Linux:

```bash
watchmedo auto-restart --patterns="*.py" --recursive -- sh -c "export \$(grep -v '^#' .env.local | xargs) && python3 functions.py serve"
```

On Windows:

```powershell
watchmedo auto-restart --patterns="*.py" --recursive -- powershell -Command "Get-Content .env.local | ForEach-Object { if ($_ -notmatch '^#') { $var = $_.Split('='); Set-Item \"env:$($var[0])\" $var[1] } }; python3 functions.py serve"
```

Make sure the port specified in your connector's `.env` file doesn't conflict with any other services you may be
running.
