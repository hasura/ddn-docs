# Integrate Existing OpenAPI-compatible Services

## Introduction

Using the [OpenAPI Lambda connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-open-api-lambda), you can instantly import
OpenAPI-compliant APIs into your GraphQL API. Any `GET` requests are tagged as `@readonly` using the Node.js Lambda
connector and are exposed as queries in your GraphQL API. All others are then exposed as procedures, allowing you to
mutate data.

:::warning Alpha state

**This connector is in an alpha state and is subject to change. It should not be used in production settings and should
only be used for exploration.**

:::info Prerequisites

If you've never used Hasura DDN, we recommend that you first go through the
[getting started](/getting-started/overview.mdx). ðŸ˜Š

Additionally, if you haven't read through the [TypeScript connector docs](/business-logic/typescript.mdx), check them
out first.
