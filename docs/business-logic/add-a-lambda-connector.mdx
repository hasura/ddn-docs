# Add a Lambda Connector

## Introduction

You can add a lambda connector just like any other [data source](/data-sources/overview.mdx).

## Add a connector

```sh title="Initialize a new connector in a project directory:"
ddn connector init <your_name_for_the_connector> -i
```

<Tabs groupId="source-preference" className="api-tabs">

<TabItem value="TypeScript" label="TypeScript">

When you add the `hasura/nodejs` connector, the CLI will generate a Node.js package with a `functions.ts` file. This
file is the entrypoint for your connector.

As this is a Node.js project, you can easily add any dependencies you desire by running `npm i <package-name>` from this
connector's directory.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python" label="Python">

When you add the `hasura/python` connector, the CLI will generate a Python application with a `functions.py` file. This
file is the entrypoint for your connector.

As this is a Python project, you can easily add any dependencies you desire by adding them to the `requirements.txt` in
this connector's directory.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Go" label="Go">

When you add the `hasura/go` connector, the CLI will generate a Go application with a `/functions` directory. The
connector will use this directory — and any `*.go` file in it — as the entrypoint for your connector.

As this is a Go project, you can easily add any dependencies you desire by adding them to the `go.mod` file and running
`go mod tidy` from this connector's directory.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::info Customization

You can customize which subgraph this connector is added to by
[changing your project's context](/reference/cli/commands/ddn_context.mdx) or using flags. More information can be found
in the [CLI docs](/reference/cli/commands/ddn_connector_init.mdx) for the `ddn connector init` command.

After adding a connector, learn [how to add custom business logic](/business-logic/tutorials/1-add-custom-logic.mdx)
written in your language of choice and expose it via your API.
