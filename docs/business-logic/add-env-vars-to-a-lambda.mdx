# Add Custom Environment Variables

## Introduction

Custom environment variables allow you to define configuration values specific to your deployment. These variables can
be used to set API keys, connection strings, or other parameters that your application or connectors need. When you run
the `ddn connector env add` command, it automatically updates multiple files to ensure the environment variables are
available across your project:

- **`.env`**: Adds the variable to the [current context's](/cli/commands/ddn_context.mdx) environment configuration file
  for easy access during development.
- **`connector.yaml`**: Updates the connector's configuration to include the variable for deployment.
- **`compose.yaml`**: Ensures the variable is included in the Docker Compose configuration for runtime.

## Add an environment variable

```sh title="From a project directory, run:"
ddn connector env add <connector_name> --env FOO=bar
```

Repeat these steps for each additional variable.

## Use an environment variable

After creating a new build and running your connector, you can access your environment variable(s) via whatever
conventions your language of choice prefers. For detailed instructions, refer to the following resources:

- **Node.js**: Using [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme)
- **Python**: Using [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
- **Go**: Using [godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv)
