# Custom Business Logic via TypeScript

## Introduction

The [Node.js Lambda Connector](https://hasura.io/connectors/nodejs) can be added to any project to incorporate custom
business logic directly into your supergraph.

This can be used to enrich data returned to clients, or to write custom mutations in TypeScript with Node.js.

:::info Prerequisites

If you've never used Hasura DDN, we recommend that you first go through the
[getting started](/getting-started/overview.mdx). 😊

:::

## Functions or Procedures

TypeScript functions defined in a file in the [Node.js Lambda Connector](https://hasura.io/connectors/nodejs) directory
and then tracked, will be available from your Hasura DDN GraphQL API in the form of either **functions** or
**procedures**.

In Hasura metadata, **functions** are used for read operations. They will not modify the data in the database and can
only be used to retrieve data.

Conversely, **procedures** are used for write operations. They can modify the data in the database and can be used to
create, update, or delete data.

The distinction is important in metadata because it allows the system to know what types to expect for arguments and
return values.

## Add the TypeScript connector to a project

### Step 1. Initialize the Node.js Lambda connector

Let's begin by initializing the connector on our project. In the example below, you'll see a familiar flow and use the
`hasura/nodejs` connector from the connector hub.

```bash title="Run the following command:"
ddn connector init my_ts -i
```

- Select `hasura/nodejs` from the list of connectors.
- Choose a port (press enter to accept the default recommended by the CLI).
- In this example, we've called the connector `my_ts`. You can name it something descriptive.

#### What did this do?

This command created the following file structure in a `app/connector/my_ts` directory, with the `functions.ts` file
being your connector's entrypoint:

```bash
.
├── .ddnignore
├── .hasura-connector
│  ├── ...
├── compose.yaml
├── connector.yaml
#highlight-start
├── functions.ts
#highlight-end
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### Step 2. Add a function

:::tip TypeScript developer tooling

You will likely edit your `functions.ts` file in a code editor with support for displaying TypeScript compiler errors
and code completions, such as Visual Studio Code. In order for the code editor tooling to work correctly you will need
to have Node.js (>= v20.0.0) installed locally and you will need to install the npm packages that the connector uses:

```bash title="In the connector directory, run this to install packages:"
npm install
```

:::

By default, a **function** — in the nomenclature of DDN — is already present in our `functions.ts` file. It's designated
as a function by the JSDoc comment using the `@readonly` tag:

```ts
/**
 * @readonly Exposes the function as an NDC function (the function should only query data without making modifications)
 */
export function hello(name?: string) {
  return `hello ${name ?? "world"}`;
}
```

You can add another function simply by exporting a valid TypeScript function.

### Step 3. Track the function

To add our function, we can use the following to generate the related metadata that will link together any functions in
this `functions.ts` file and our API.

```bash title="Introspect the connector:"
ddn connector introspect my_ts
```

Then, we can generate an `hml` file for the function using the following command.

```bash title="Track the function:"
ddn command add my_ts hello
```

:::info Have a lot of functions?

If you have a lot of functions and want to add them all en masse, you can use the CLI to generate metadata for each.

```bash title="Run the following:"
ddn command add my_ts "*"
```

:::

#### What did this do?

The command introspected your `functions.ts` file and found any functions present along with their argument and return
types.

The CLI then used this to create Hasura metadata for each function which can then be exposed in your API.

:::info Each function or procedure has tracked metadata

<details>
<summary>For the boilerplate `hello()` function included by default, you'll see a `Hello.hml` file in the `metadata`
directory of the subgraph. Click here to check it out »</summary>

```yaml
---
kind: Command
version: v1
definition:
  name: Hello
  outputType: String!
  arguments:
    - name: name
      type: String
  source:
    dataConnectorName: my_ts
    dataConnectorCommand:
      function: hello
  graphql:
    rootFieldName: hello
    rootFieldKind: Query

---
kind: CommandPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  commandName: Hello
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      allowExecution: true
```

</details>

:::

### Step 4. Create a new API build and test

Next, let's create a new build of our supergraph:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
```

:::tip Start your engines!

Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine using the following command.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn run docker-start
```

This reads the `docker-start` script from the context config at `.hasura/context.yaml` and starts your Hasura engine,
any connectors, and observability tools.

:::

You should see your command available, along with its documentation, in the GraphiQL explorer on the console which you
should be able to access using:

```bash title="Run:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title=" You can then test your new function with the following query:"
query MyQuery {
  hello(name: "Hasura")
}
```

<br />

:::tip Privacy settings in some browsers

Your browser settings or privacy tools may prevent the Console from accessing your local Hasura instance. This could be
due to features designed to protect your privacy and security. Should you encounter one of these issues, we recommend
disabling these settings for the `console.hasura.io` domain.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) are the recommended
browsers for the best experience with the Hasura Console including for local development.

:::

:::note Running Node.js locally

By default, Node.js and your functions run in a Docker container along with your other Hasura services. The
`connector init` command created a `compose.yaml` file for you, which are used by default.

However, if you prefer to run Node.js directly on your local machine, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version `>=20.0.0` installed on your machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash title="Change to the connector directory and install dependencies:"
cd my_subgraph/connector/my_ts && npm i
```

3. From the `my_ts` directory, run this command to load environment variables from your project's `.env` file, start the
   connector, and watch for any changes:

```bash title="Run the connector with env vars loaded from config"
ddn connector setenv --connector connector.yaml -- npm run start
```

Make sure the port specified in your connector's `.env` file doesn't conflict with any other services you may be
running.

:::

## Add a procedure

Inside the same `functions.ts` file, let's add a custom mutation in the form of a **procedure**. A procedure is simply a
TypeScript function that is exported from `functions.ts` that does _not_ have the `@readonly` JSDoc annotation.

For example, let's say you want to add a custom mutation to create a user in a PostgreSQL table on your default `app`
subgraph and also hash their password before storing it.

You can do this by first installing the [`pg` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) (the PostgreSQL client) and the
[`bcrypt` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) (to hash the password). You should also install their
associated TypeScript types packages. You are not limited to these packages; you can install any combination of Node.js
packages that you need and use them at will.

```bash title="In the connector directory, run the following commands to install the packages:"
npm install pg bcrypt
npm install --save-dev @types/pg @types/bcrypt
```

Once those packages are installed, you add the following code to the `functions.ts` file:

```typescript
import { Client } from "pg";
import bcrypt from "bcrypt";

// Define a type to capture a new user's details using TypeScript
type NewUser = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string; // Add a password field to the User type
};

// Define a type to capture the created User
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

/**
 * Inserts a user into the database and returns the inserted user.
 * Hash password for secure storage.
 *
 * @param user The user to insert into the database. Expects a name, email, and password.
 * @returns The user that was inserted into the database.
 */
export async function insertUser(user: NewUser): Promise<User> {
  // Get your database connection string.
  // NB!! Use env vars for this in production NB!!
  const connectionString = "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydb";

  const client = new Client({
    connectionString,
  });
  await client.connect();

  // Hash the user's password before storing it
  const saltRounds = 10; // Pretty decent number of rounds
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, saltRounds);

  const result = await client.query(
    `INSERT INTO users (name, email, password) VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING *`,
    [user.name, user.email, hashedPassword] // Use the hashed password here
  );

  const rows = result.rows.map((row) => ({
    id: row.id,
    name: row.name,
    email: row.email,
    // Do not return the password field for security reasons
  }));

  await client.end();

  return rows[0];
}
```

This:

- creates a function called `insertUser`.
- takes in a user's name, email, and password.
- hashes their password.
- inserts into the `users` table in the database.
- returns the inserted user without password.

Now you can re-introspect your connector and generate an `hml` file for the function using the following commands:

```bash title="Introspect the connector and track the new function:"
ddn connector introspect my_ts
ddn command add my_ts insertUser
```

Don't forget to rebuild and restart your GraphQL engine after making these changes!

```bash title="Create a new local build and restart your Docker containers:"
ddn supergraph build local
ddn run docker-start
```

## Testing

After you've generated the metadata for the function or procedure and created a new build, you can use this in your
GraphQL API.
