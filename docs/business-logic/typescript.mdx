# Custom Business Logic via TypeScript

## Introduction

The [Node.js Lambda Connector](https://hasura.io/connectors/nodejs-lambda) can be added to any project to incorporate
custom business logic directly into your supergraph.

This can be used to enrich data returned to clients, or to write custom mutations in TypeScript with Node.js.

:::info Prerequisites

If you've never used Hasura DDN, we recommend that you first go through the
[getting started](/getting-started/overview.mdx). 😊

:::

## Functions or Procedures

TypeScript functions defined in a file in the [Node.js Lambda Connector](https://hasura.io/connectors/nodejs-lambda)
directory and then tracked, will be available from your Hasura DDN GraphQL API in the form of either **functions**
or **procedures**.

In Hasura metadata, **functions** are used for read operations. They will not modify the data in the database and can
only be used to retrieve data.

Conversely, **procedures** are used for write operations. They can modify the data in the database and can be used to
create, update, or delete data.

The distinction is important in metadata because it allows the system to know what types to expect for arguments and
return values.

## Add the TypeScript connector to a project

### Step 1. Initialize the Node.js Lambda connector

Let's begin by initializing the connector on our project. In the example below, you'll see a familiar flow and use the
`hasura/nodejs` connector from the connector hub.

```bash title="Run the following command:"
ddn connector init -i
```

- Select `hasura/nodejs` from the list of connectors.
- Name it something descriptive. For this example, we'll call it `my_ts`.
- Choose a port (press enter to accept the default recommended by the CLI).

#### What did this do?

This command created the following file structure in a `app/connector/my_ts` directory, with the `functions.ts`
file being your connector's entrypoint:

```bash
.
├── .ddnignore
├── .hasura-connector
│  ├── ...
├── compose.yaml
├── connector.yaml
#highlight-start
├── functions.ts
#highlight-end
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### Step 2. Install npm package dependencies

:::warning Node.js version

The `hasura/nodejs` connector requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version `>=20.0.0`. Please make sure you have
the correct version installed.

:::

Let's install any necessary dependencies:

```bash title="Change to the connector directory and install dependencies:"
cd app/connector/my_ts && npm i
```

### Step 3. Run the connector

Then, from the `my_ts` directory run this command to load environment variables
from your project's `.env` file, start the connector, and watch for any changes:

```bash
ddn connector setenv --connector connector.yaml -- npm run start
```

## Add a function

By default, a **function** — in the nomenclature of DDN — is already present in our `functions.ts` file. It's designated
as a function by the JSDoc comment using the `@readonly` tag:

```ts
/**
 * @readonly Exposes the function as an NDC function (the function should only query data without making modifications)
 */
export function hello(name?: string) {
  return `hello ${name ?? "world"}`;
}
```

You can add another function simply by exporting a valid TypeScript function.

:::tip Start your engines!

Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine using the following command.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn run docker-start
```

This reads `docker-start` script from the context config at `.hasura/context.yaml` and starts our Hasura Engine and
observability tools.

:::

### Step 5. Track the function

To add our function, we can use the following to generate the related metadata that will link together any functions
in this `functions.ts` file and our API.

```bash title="Track the function:"
ddn connector introspect my_ts
```

Then, we can generate an `hml` file for the function using the following command.

```bash title="Track the function:"
ddn command add my_ts hello
```

:::info Have a lot of functions?

If you have a lot of functions and want to add them all en masse, you can use the CLI to generate metadata for each.

```bash title="Run the following:"
ddn connector-link add-resources my_ts
```

:::

#### What did this do?

The command introspected your `functions.ts` file and found any functions present along with their argument and return
types.

The CLI then used this to create Hasura metadata for each function which can then be exposed in your API.

:::info Each function or procedure has tracked metadata

<details>
<summary>For the boilerplate `hello()` function included by default, you'll see a `Hello.hml` file in the `commands` subdirectory
of the connector. Click here to check it out »</summary>

```yaml
---
kind: Command
version: v1
definition:
  name: Hello
  outputType: String!
  arguments:
    - name: name
      type: String
  source:
    dataConnectorName: my_ts
    dataConnectorCommand:
      function: hello
  graphql:
    rootFieldName: hello
    rootFieldKind: Query

---
kind: CommandPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  commandName: Hello
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      allowExecution: true

```

</details>

:::

### Step 6. Create a new API build and test

Next, let's create a new build of our supergraph:

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
```

You should see your command available, along with its documentation, in the GraphiQL explorer which you should be able
to access using the CLI.

```bash title="Run:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title=" You can then test your new function with the following query:"
query MyQuery {
  hello(name: "Hasura")
}
```

:::tip Privacy settings in some browsers

Your browser settings or privacy tools may prevent the Console from accessing your local Hasura instance. This could be
due to features designed to protect your privacy and security. Should you encounter one of these issues, we recommend
disabling these settings for the `console.hasura.io` domain.

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) are the recommended
browsers for the best experience with the Hasura Console including for local development.

:::

:::note Running Node.js in Docker

As you can see we're running Node.js and your functions directly on your own machine. You can also run your functions in
a Docker container along with your other Hasura services. The `connector init` command created a `Dockerfile` and a
`compose.yaml` file for you, so all you would need to do would be to:

- Make sure your port in your connector's `.env` and the one referenced in the
  `my_subgraph/connector/my_ts/compose.yaml` file match and don't conflict with any other services you may need to run.
- Add the Node.js Lambda connector compose file to the main compose file in the root of the project if you want them to
  start all together. Eg:

```yaml title="At the top of the root compose.yaml"
include:
  - path: my_subgraph/connector/my_ts/compose.yaml
```

:::


## Add a procedure

Inside the same `functions.ts` file, let's add a custom mutation in the form of a **procedure**.

For example, let's say you want to add a custom mutation to create a user in a PostgreSQL table on your default `app`
subgraph and also hash their password before storing it.

You can do this by adding the following code to the `functions.ts` file:

```typescript
import { Client } from "pg";
import bcrypt from "bcrypt";

// Define the User type using TypeScript
type User = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string; // Add a password field to the User type
};

/**
 * Inserts a user into the database and returns the inserted user.
 * Hash password for secure storage.
 *
 * @param user The user to insert into the database. Expects a name, email, and password.
 * @returns The user that was inserted into the database.
 */
export async function insertUser(user: User): Promise<Omit<User, "password">> {
  // Get your database connection string.
  // NB!! Use env vars for this in production NB!!
  const connectionString = "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydb";

  const client = new Client({
    connectionString,
  });
  await client.connect();

  // Hash the user's password before storing it
  const saltRounds = 10; // Pretty decent number of rounds
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, saltRounds);

  const result = await client.query(
    `INSERT INTO users (name, email, password) VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING *`,
    [user.name, user.email, hashedPassword], // Use the hashed password here
  );

  const rows = result.rows.map((row) => ({
    id: row.id,
    name: row.name,
    email: row.email,
    // Do not return the password field for security reasons
  }));

  await client.end();

  return rows[0];
}
```

This:

- creates a function called `insertUser`.
- takes in a user's name, email, and password.
- hashes their password.
- inserts into the `users` table in the database.
- returns the inserted user without password.

We're using the [`pg` PostgreSQL client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) to connect to the database and run the query
and [`bcrypt` to hash the password](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt), but since this is a Node.js Lambda function,
you can use any combination of Node.js libraries you want.

You can then repeat this process to scale your mutations independently.

## Testing

After you've generated the metadata for the function or procedure and created a new build, you can use this in your
GraphQL API.
