# Basics

## What is a data source?

When we talk about data, many people first think of structured tables in a database. While that’s a significant part of
the picture, data comes in many forms—some structured, others not. A data source, in the context of Hasura DDN, can be
as straightforward as a relational database or as dynamic as the output of a custom function.

With Hasura DDN, you can connect it all and serve it from a single endpoint.

## How do I connect my data to Hasura DDN?

We use **native data connectors** to make your data accessible through a GraphQL API. These connectors are tailored for
specific sources, including relational databases, NoSQL, external GraphQL APIs, REST APIs, and more.

We have the following data connectors available today:

## Building your own data connector

You are also able to build your own data connector. This is useful if you have a custom data source that is not
supported. You can find information for this in the [NDC Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec) and the rendered
[NDC Spec data connector tutorial](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/tutorial/index.html) as well as the SDKs for
various languages:

- [Rust](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-rs)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript)
- [Python](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-python)
- [Go](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-go)
