# Basics

## What is a data source?

When we talk about data, many people first think of structured tables in a database. While that’s a significant part of
the picture, data comes in many forms—some structured, others not. A data source, in the context of Hasura DDN, can be
as straightforward as a relational database or as dynamic as the output of a custom function.

With Hasura DDN, you can connect it all and serve it from a single endpoint.

## How do I connect my data to Hasura DDN?

specific sources, including relational databases, NoSQL, external GraphQL APIs, REST APIs, and more.
