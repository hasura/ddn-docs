# Introspect a source

## Introduction

This guide explains how to use a connector to introspect a data source. After introspection, you'll be ready to begin
generating Hasura metadata that represents resources (such as tables or collections) in your data source.

You'll need an [initialized data connector](/data-sources/connect-to-a-source.mdx) before attempting to introspect a
source.

## Step 1. Run the introspect command

```sh title="All connectors use the same command to introspect a data source:"
ddn connector introspect <name_of_connector>
```

The CLI will reach out to your data source and update the configuration files with information about your source schema.
This will vary depending on the connector but, at a minimum, you'll see source-specific information updated in two
files, both located in your connector's directory:

| File                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `configuration.json`      | An [Open Data Domain Specification](https://github.com/hasura/open-data-domain-specification) description of your data source. The CLI uses this file to update the DataConnectorLink object with information about your data source. |
| `<name_of_connector>.hml` | Contains the [DataConnectorLink](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx) for your connector.                                                                                                                                   |

:::info When to use this command

This command will be used at least once with every connector; Hasura **must** introspect your data source in order to
understand the resources that are present.

**Additionally, any time you modify your source schema, you should re-run this command to ensure your Hasura metadata is
up-to-date with your source schema.**

## Next steps

With your source introspected and the configuration files populated, you can now start creating Hasura metadata that
will represent your source's schema in your API. Check out the [schema design section](#) to begin creating models,
commands, and relationships for your data.
