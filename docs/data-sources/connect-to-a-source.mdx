# Connect to a source

## Introduction

This guide explains how to initialize a connector, configure its environment variables, and link it to your data source.
Once initialized, you'll be ready to introspect the source and integrate it into your API.

You'll need a [project](/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_init.mdx) before initializing a connector.

## Step 1. Initialize a connector

Regardless which connector you're using, you'll always begin by initializing it with a unique name:

```sh title="Initialize a new connector in a project directory:"
ddn connector init <your_name_for_the_connector> -i
```

A wizard will appear with a dropdown list. If you know the name of the connector, start typing the name. Otherwise, use
the arrows to scroll through the list. Hit `ENTER` when you've selected your desired connector; you'll then be prompted
to enter some values.

:::info Customization

You can customize which subgraph this connector is added to by
[changing your project's context](/cli/commands/ddn_context.mdx) or using flags. More information can be found in the
[CLI docs](/cli/commands/ddn_connector_init.mdx) for the `ddn connector init` command.

## Step 2. Add environment variables

The CLI will assign a random port for the connector to use during local development. You can hit `ENTER` to accept the
suggested value or enter your own. Then, depending on your connector, there may be a set of environment variables that
it requires:

<Tabs groupId="source-preference" className="api-tabs">

<TabItem value="PostgreSQL" label="PostgreSQL">

| ENV              | Example                                       | Description                                                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CONNECTION_URI` | `postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname` | The full connection string used to connect to the PostgreSQL database. |

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="MongoDB" label="MongoDB">

| ENV            | Example                        | Description                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MONGO_DB_URL` | `mongodb://host:27017/db_name` | The full connection string — **including the database name** — used to connect to the MongoDB instance. |

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ClickHouse" label="ClickHouse">

| ENV                 | Example             | Description                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CONNECTION_STRING` | `https://host:8123` | The HTTP(S) connection string to the ClickHouse instance. |
| `USERNAME`          | `default`           | The database username.                                    |
| `PASSWORD`          | `default`           | The database password.                                    |

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

If your data source requires a connection string or endpoint, the CLI will confirm that it successfully tested the
connection to your source. Additionally, it generates configuration files, which you can find in the `connector`
directory of the subgraph where you added the connector (default: `app`). Finally, the CLI will create a
[DataConnectorLink](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx) in your connector's `metadata` directory.

## Next steps

Now that you've initialized a connector and connected it to your data, you're ready to introspect the source and
populate the configuration files with source-specific information that Hasura will need to build your API. Check out the
[introspection page](/data-sources/introspect-a-source.mdx) to learn more.
