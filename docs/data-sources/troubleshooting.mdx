# Troubleshooting

## Common issues

### My connector can't connect to the data source

When initializing a new connector, we verify the connection string you provide to ensure your data source is reachable.
If this process fails, try the following solutions:

#### Your source isn't accessible to the public internet

If your data source is hosted behind a firewall or restricts access to specific IP addresses, it may block external
connections. Unless you're using [Private DDN](https://hasura.io/pricing), you need to allow access from all IP
addresses. You can do this by adding the following to your allowlist:

```plaintext
0.0.0.0/0
```

#### Docker networking issues

Hasura DDN resolves `local.hasura.dev` to your machine's `localhost`. This avoids Docker networking conflicts, where
`localhost` might point to your source's container instead of your local machine. To fix this, update any `localhost`
references in your connection strings to `local.hasura.dev`.

### There's a port conflict for my connector

Use `docker ps` to check for any running processes that would conflict with your source's container. If you find one,
kill it and then try initializing the connector again.

### My connector isn't reflecting schema changes in my data source

You may have not re-run the introspection steps. Remember, each time your data source's schema changes, you'll need to
re-run this command to make Hasura DDN aware of the new schema. Follow the guide
[here](/data-sources/introspect-a-source.mdx).

### My connector isn't reflecting schema changes in my API

If you've modified your metadata and are getting errors when trying to use your API, you may need to force a rebuild of
the connector.

Identify the connector's container and image; kill the container and delete the image. Then, re-run the
`ddn run docker-start` command to rebuild the connector's image in addition to your other services.

### GitHub

Each connector has a public repository on GitHub. Typically, they'll follow the naming convention of
`hasura/ndc-<connector-name>`. Create issues on these repositories to get help directly from the teams responsible for
the connectors.
