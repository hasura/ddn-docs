# Role emulation

## Introduction

You can configure authentication to allow certain roles to emulate other roles. This can be useful during development
to test access control rules without setting up authentication.

To set up role emulation, the `AuthConfig` Hasura metadata object accepts a field called `allowRoleEmulationFor`.

When `allowRoleEmulationFor` is set up, Hasura will check for the value of the `x-hasura-role` session variable
which is returned in the webhook or JWT response to be equal to the value set in the `allowRoleEmulationFor`. If the
values are equal, then role emulation will be enabled for that request. When role emulation is enabled for a request,
the session variables, including the role, will be considered from the HTTP request headers instead.

For example,

Hasura is set up with the following auth config:

```json
{
  "type": "AuthConfig",
  "allowRoleEmulationFor": "admin",
  "webhook": {
    "webhookUrl": "https://myauth.service.com/validate-request"
  }
}
```

and the following GraphQL request is made:

```http
POST /graphql HTTP/2.0
Content-Type: application/json
x-hasura-role: user
x-hasura-user-id: 2

{
  "query": "query GetUser { user { id name } }",
  "variables": null,
  "operationName": "GetUser"
}
```

### Successful role emulation

Let's assume the webhook response is as following:

```json
{
  "x-hasura-role": "admin",
  "x-hasura-user-id": 1
}
```

Then, the GraphQL request will be executed as the `user` role, instead of the `admin` role and the session variables
from the HTTP request headers will be considered. So, in this case, the value of the session variable `x-hasura-user-id`
will be 2, instead of 1.

### Unsuccessful role emulation

If the webhook response were the following:

```json
{
  "x-hasura-role": "author",
  "x-hasura-user-id": 1
}
```

Then, the GraphQL query will be executed as the `author` role and **only** the session variables from the authentication
webhook response will be considered. So, in this case, the value of the session variable `x-hasura-user-id` will be 1.
