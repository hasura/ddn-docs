# Hasura DDN Billing

## Overview

With Hasura DDN, you can setup billing in just a few steps. All you need to do is add a credit card to your plan and
you're off to the races!

:::tip Start your free trial!

The DDN Base Trial Plan and DDN Advanced Trial Plan offer new users the opportunity to experience our **DDN Base Plan**
and **DDN Advanced Plan** free of charge for 30 days.

The trials are activated immediately and are free for 30 days. Once the trial period ends, the account or project plan
will automatically downgrade to the last active non-trial plan (either DDN Free or DDN Base). You will not be charged or
automatically converted to the DDN Base or Advanced plan after the trial expires. These trials are available only once
per user.

During the DDN Base trial, you'll have access to all features, including: unlimited collaboration for your team,
real-time performance metrics and query tracing, model and field analytics, insights for the last 30 days, and schema
registry and tracking.

During the DDN Advanced trial, you'll have access to all DDN Base features and all features of DDN Advanced, including:
modular metadata management, multi-repo CI/CD, continuous validation, and team-based governance. You can upgrade at any
time before the trial expires by adding your credit card, and we will notify you two weeks before your trial period
ends.

This ensures you can explore the full benefits of both plans without any commitment or automatic billing.
