# Overview

There are a few ways to get help with Hasura DDN.

## 1. Check the docs

Obviously, these docs are a great place to start.

First, check out the [quickstart](/quickstart.mdx) guide to get started, and/or the
[tutorials](/how-to-build-with-ddn/overview.mdx) to get started with your chosen first data source. You can then move on
to the [data sources](data-sources/overview.mdx) and [data modeling](data-modeling/overview.mdx) sections to learn how
to model and work with your data. You will then likely want to jump around to other sections such as
[auth](auth/overview.mdx), [observability](observability/overview.mdx), [deployment](deployment/overview.mdx), and more.

Also check out the [frequently asked questions](/help/faq.mdx) and the [glossary](/help/glossary.mdx) in this help
section.
