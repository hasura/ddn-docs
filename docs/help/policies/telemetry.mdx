# Telemetry Guide/FAQ

## Introduction

Hasura DDN collects anonymous telemetry data that helps the Hasura team in understanding how the product is being used
and in deciding what to focus on next.

The data collected is minimal, statistical in nature and **cannot be used to uniquely identify a user**. Please see the
next section to see what data is collected and sent. Access to collected data is strictly limited to the Hasura team and
not shared with 3rd parties.

As a growing community, we greatly appreciate the usage data users send to us, as it is very valuable in helping us make
Hasura DDN a better product for everyone!

## What data is collected?

### Server

Hasura DDN periodically sends the number of models, commands, relationships, and permission rules tracked in a project,
along with randomly generated UUIDs per database and per instance. The name of the current continuous integration
environment (if any) and the server version is also sent.

### Console

The console collects runtime errors along with anonymized route names that are sent without any identifiable information
or payload. The console also records the UUID of the server/CLI that it is connected to.

### CLI

The CLI collects each execution event, along with a randomly generated UUID. The execution event contains the command
name, timestamp and whether the execution resulted in an error or not. **Error messages, arguments and flags are not
recorded**. The CLI also collects the server version and UUID that it is talking to. The operating system platform and
architecture is also noted along with the CLI version.

## Where is the data sent?

The data is sent to Hasura's servers addressed by `telemetry.hasura.io`.
