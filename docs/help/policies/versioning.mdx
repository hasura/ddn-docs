# Hasura Version Support Policy

## Releases and support

Hasura DDN releases its software via independently versioned components, such as:

- **Engine**
- **Connectors**
- **CLI**

Each of these components is released independently, and while versions are used, there are no "versioned" releases of
the product as a whole. Versions follow semantic versioning:

- **Major versions** may include incompatible or breaking changes.
- **Minor versions** introduce new functionality and bug fixes in a backwards-compatible manner.
- **Patch versions** provide backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Hasura provides support for eligible customers on a per-component basis, with support including:

1. **Bug fixes**: Critical issues or bugs identified in a component are either provided a workaround or addressed
   through minor or patch versions.
2. **Security updates**: Updates are provided via patches to address known security vulnerabilities.
3. **Technical support**: Assistance is provided for issues or questions about individual components.

Support is available for the latest minor version of the previous major version of each component, including critical
security updates, for up to one year after the release of the current major version of that component.

You can find the latest versions and changelog entries for each component on the
[Hasura Changelog](https://hasura.io/changelog).
