# Hasura Version Support Policy

## Releases and support

Hasura DDN releases its software via independently versioned components, such as:

- **Engine**
- **Connectors**
- **CLI**

Each of these components is released independently, and while versions are used, there are no "versioned" releases of
the product as a whole. Versions follow semantic versioning:

- **Major versions** may include incompatible or breaking changes.
- **Minor versions** introduce new functionality and bug fixes in a backwards-compatible manner.
- **Patch versions** provide backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Hasura provides support for eligible customers on a per-component basis, with support including:

1. **Bug fixes**: Critical issues or bugs identified in a component are either provided a workaround or addressed
   through minor or patch versions.
2. **Security updates**: Updates are provided via patches to address known security vulnerabilities.
3. **Technical support**: Assistance is provided for issues or questions about individual components.

Support is available for the latest minor version of the previous major version of each component, including critical
security updates, for up to one year after the release of the current major version of that component.

You can find the latest versions and changelog entries for each component on the
[Hasura Changelog](https://hasura.io/changelog).

:::info calver vs. semver

The **Engine** utilizes [calver (calendar versioning)](https://calver.org/) instead of semver, with versions aligned to
the year, month, and date of the release. This approach provides clarity on the recency of releases.

## Reporting bugs and requesting fixes

Hasura is committed to providing enterprise-grade reliability and support to ensure your business operates seamlessly.
For bug reporting and resolution, the following process ensures efficiency and transparency:

1. **Reporting Bugs**:

   - Bugs can be reported through the [Hasura Support Portal](https://support.hasura.io/hc/en-us/requests/new).
   - Customers are encouraged to provide detailed descriptions, logs, and replication steps to help expedite resolution.

2. **Bug Triage and Prioritization**:

   - Reported issues are triaged based on severity and impact, prioritizing critical bugs that affect system security,
     availability, or functionality.
   - Issues impacting production environments are escalated for immediate attention.

3. **Bug Fix Releases**:
   - Fixes for critical issues are rolled out as patch updates. Non-critical issues are included in the subsequent minor
     or major releases.
   - Customers are notified through release notes, the [Hasura Changelog](https://hasura.io/changelog), and direct
     communication for mission-critical updates.

1. **Proactive Security Patching**:

   - Vulnerabilities are addressed promptly with targeted patch updates.
   - Security patches are backward-compatible and applied to supported versions.

2. **Customer Communication**:

   - Security updates are communicated directly to enterprise customers through our Customer Success team and email
     notifications.
   - Detailed documentation and guidance are provided to ensure smooth implementation of critical updates.
