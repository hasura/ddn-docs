### zsh

```sh title="To load completions in the current session:"
source <(ddn completion zsh)
```

**Permanent set up**

```sh title="Ensure shell completion is enabled by adding the following to your ~/.zshrc file:"
echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
```

#### macOS

```sass
ddn completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_ddn
```

#### Linux

ddn completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_ddn"
```

:::note

### PowerShell

#### Step 1. Generate the auto-completion script

Run the following command to generate the script for enabling auto-completion:

```sh
ddn completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

$PROFILE
```

Common paths for the PowerShell profile are:

- Windows PowerShell: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
- PowerShell Core: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

#### Step 3. Edit your PowerShell profile

```sh title="Open the profile in a text editor:"
notepad $PROFILE
```

```plaintext title="Add the following line to the end of the file:"
ddn completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```
