```sass
ddn completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

Locate your PowerShell profile by running the following command:
```sass
$PROFILE
```

Common paths for the PowerShell profile are:
 - Windows PowerShell: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
 - PowerShell Core: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

Edit your PowerShell Profile

Open the profile in a text editor: 
```sass
notepad $PROFILE
```
Add the following line to the end of the file:
```sass
ddn completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```
Save the file and close the editor.
