# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I see debug logs from CLI commands?

Add `--log-level=debug` to the command to see debug logs from the CLI.

## How do I see the output in JSON or YAML format instead of the table format that is shown by default?

Use `--out=json` or `--out=yaml` to see the output in the corresponding format instead of JSON.

## How do I see the version of the DDN CLI?

Run `ddn version` to see the CLI version.

## Why does my engine container crash upon running `ddn run docker-start` during local development?

Engine container can crash due to various reasons. Some of common reasons are:
- The mandatory env vars required to configure the engine were not provided.
- The metadata files required by engine is invalid or non existent.
- The engine version is not up to date to handle new metadata objects.

#### The mandatory env vars required to configure the engine were not provided

In this case, verify that the env vars `AUTHN_CONFIG_PATH`, `INTROSPECTION_METADATA_FILE` and
`METADATA_PATH` are passed to the engine container.

The default docker compose file generated by the CLI passes these values to the engine container:

```
AUTHN_CONFIG_PATH: /md/auth_config.json
ENABLE_CORS: "true"
INTROSPECTION_METADATA_FILE: /md/metadata.json
METADATA_PATH: /md/open_dd.json
OTLP_ENDPOINT: http://local.hasura.dev:4317
```

`AUTHN_CONFIG_PATH`, `INTROSPECTION_METADATA_FILE` and the `METADATA_PATH` are the paths to the
files created as a result of `ddn supergraph build local`. These paths should be configured
based on where it is mounted in the engine container.

#### The metadata files required by engine is invalid or non existent {#engine-env-var-config}

<Thumbnail src="/img/cli/metadata_files_err.png" alt="Metadata files engine container error" width="1000px" />

These are the files created as a result of `ddn supergraph build local`. If these files do not exist, then
it can be recreated by running the command.

Make sure the files are mounted to the engine container and the paths to it configured using the environment variables
mentioned in [this section](#engine-env-var-config).

By default the CLI generates these files inside `engine/build` of the project directory and this directory is copied
when building the engine image by the following Dockerfile specified in the `dockerfile` field of the default docker compose file.

```
FROM ghcr.io/hasura/v3-engine
COPY ./build /md/
```

#### The engine version is not up to date to handle new metadata objects

New features introduced in DDN may have new metadata objects or fields associated with it. If your metadata uses
any of these new objects but the engine version you are running is an older version that doesn't support these objects,
then the engine will fail to startup. This can be resolved by using the latest engine version.

## `ddn run docker-start` is using a different ddn binary than the one in the current shell. {#docker-start-different-binary}

The `ddn run` command is just a convenient way to run arbitrary commands defined in the `scripts` section of
`.hasura/context.yaml` of the project directory.

The `docker-start` is just the name of the script defined in this file. You can see the definition of the script
by going to `.hasura/context.yaml`.

As these scripts run in a new shell, the DDN CLI must be present in the path for it to be invoked correctly when the
script is run.

## How do I check that all the required dependencies for the CLI are installed?

The DDN CLI provides a `ddn doctor` command that checks that all the required dependencies are installed.

## How to use the latest version of engine for local development?

If you're running `ddn run docker-start`, then by default it uses the `--pull` flag when bringing up docker containers.

If you're running the docker compose command directly, then use `--pull` flag.

## Why are traces are not showing up for local development?

The local engine container and all connector containers send its traces to the OpenTelemetry Collector container which
is defined in the default docker compose file initialized by the DDN ClI.

The traces are then exported to a cloud endpoint by the OpenTelemetry container as defined in the `otel-collector-config.yaml`
file initialized by the CLI by default in the project directory. For this, the OpenTelemetry Collector requires a PAT token.

If you are not able to see traces during local development:
- Make sure you are logged in to the DDN CLI. If not log in by running `ddn auth login`.
- If you are logged in, make sure you are able to see a PAT token by running `ddn auth print-pat`.
- Make sure that your OpenTelemetry Collector container is running.
- If you are running the docker compose command directly, then make sure that the environment variable `HASURA_DDN_PAT` is passed to the OpenTelemetry Collector container. The value
  for this env var would be the output of the `ddn auth print-pat` command. If you are running `ddn run docker-start`, then this
  is already handled for you.
- If you are getting the issue with `ddn run docker-start`, then it could be due to the issue described in [this section](#docker-start-different-binary).

## I'm unable to use the latest features in my project.

If you are not able to see newly introduced features, then it could be because your metadata is outdated. New features like
subscriptions may have corresponding changes to the metadata. If your metadata was initialized by an older version of the CLI, then
these features may not be available.

You can learn more about upgrading your metadata by visiting [this page](/project-configuration/upgrading-project-config/deprecated-metadata-upgrades).
