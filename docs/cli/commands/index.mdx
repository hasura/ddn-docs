# DDN CLI: Commands

## Overview

The DDN CLI utilizes a typical command / flag syntax enabling you to quickly manage your supergraph. A typical command
structure will follow this pattern:

```bash
ddn <command> <subcommand> <argument> --<flag> "<flag_value>"
```

:::info Note

A complete list of all CLI commands, including details and examples, can be found in the side navigation to the left
under the Commands heading.

:::

## Environment variables

You can configure additional behavior for the CLI using environment variables.

### `HASURA_DDN_PROJECT_DIRECTORY`

Set the `HASURA_DDN_PROJECT_DIRECTORY` environment variable to the path of your project directory, which contains the `hasura.yaml` file. This is helpful when scripting automations and ensures that any scripts or commands run from different locations will automatically reference the correct project configuration.

## Getting help

You can use the `--help` flag to get information on any command.

For example, running `ddn --help` will return information on all available operations and flags:

```

DDDDDDD\   DDDDDDD\   NN\   NN\
DD  __DD\  DD  __DD\  NNN\  NN |
DD |  DD | DD |  DD | NNNN\ NN |
DD |  DD | DD |  DD | NN NN\NN |
DD |  DD | DD |  DD | NN \NNNN |
DD |  DD | DD |  DD | NN |\NNN |
DDDDDDD  | DDDDDDD  | NN | \NN |
\_______/  \_______/  \__|  \__|
