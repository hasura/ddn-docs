# Hasura Authorization

## Introduction

**Authorization determines what a verified user can access.**

You can define permissions (also known as access control or authorization rules) on
[output types](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx), [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx), and
[commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) in your data domain.

There are three forms of permissions:

- **Type Permissions**: Define which fields within an [ObjectType](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx) can be accessed by a
  particular role.
- **Model Permissions**: Define which rows of a [Model](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) can be accessed by a particular
  role.
- **Command Permissions**: Define if a [Command](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) can be executed by a particular
  role.

A role comes into existence when it is defined in one of these three ways.

Every request to Hasura should carry the necessary session variables or roles from your authentication service. The
presence and values of these roles determine which permissions apply to the request. There is no longer the concept of a
built-in, default, super-user `admin` role in Hasura DDN.

Hasura's roles and permissions are implemented at the Hasura Engine layer. They have no direct relationship to any data
source users and roles.

## Examples

For examples of authorization permissions in metadata, see the [permissions page](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx)
in the Supergraph modeling section.

## Testing Permissions

You can test permissions directly in the Hasura Console's API interface:

1. Define the desired permissions for a particular type, model, or command in your metadata.
2. Make a request through the Hasura DDN Console GraphiQL API interface with an auth token that resolves to the
   required session variables.
3. Check the returned data to ensure it adheres to your permission configurations.
