# Authentication Using JWTs

## Introduction

This page details how to configure Hasura DDN to use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in order to authenticate incoming requests.

This process requires that your auth service returns a JWT to the client, which it passes to the Hasura Engine in a
header of the request.

Hasura then verifies and decodes the JWT to extract `x-hasura-*` session variable claim values. The `x-hasura-role`
session variable is required, and you will also most likely utilize the user id and any other information which you need
to determine access to your data.
