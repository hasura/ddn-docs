# Authentication & Hasura

## Introduction

**Authentication verifies the identity of a user.**

Hasura DDN utilizes session variables, with specific user, role, organization and any other information you may need to
determine the data access rights of the user.

With these session variables you are able to define permission rules on your data domain to provide fine-grained access
control to resources.

Hasura is agnostic about your authentication service. Hasura delegates the responsibility of generating session
variables to your new or existing authentication service, thereby providing you with the greatest flexibility and range
of options for your authentication needs.

Authentication can be configured via JSON web tokens (JWT) or a webhook service and can be integrated with any provider
you choose (e.g., [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth),
[AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), a custom solution, etc.) in order to verify the user and set session
variables that then control access to data.
