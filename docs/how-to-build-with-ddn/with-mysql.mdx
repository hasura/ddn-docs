# Get Started with Hasura DDN and MySQL

## Overview

This tutorial takes about twenty minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to a MySQL database
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query
- Create relationships

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

This tutorial assumes you're starting from scratch; you'll connect a locally-running MySQL instance to Hasura, but you
can easily follow the steps if you already have data seeded. Hasura will never modify your source schema.

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Initialize your MySQL connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_mysql -i
```

From the dropdown, select `/hasura/mysql` (you can type to filter the list). Then, enter the following JDBC URL:

```plaintext
jdbc:mysql://user:password@local.hasura.dev:3306/mydb
```

### Step 4. Start the local MySQL container and Adminer

```sh title="Begin by creating a compose file for the MySQL service:"
touch app/connector/my_mysql/compose.mysql.yaml
```

```yaml title="Then, open the file and add the following:"
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    container_name: mysql-db
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
      MYSQL_USER: user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql
    command:
      - --character-set-server=utf8mb4
      - --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci
      - --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password

  adminer:
    image: adminer:latest
    container_name: adminer
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER: mysql

volumes:
  mysql-data:
```

```sh title="Run the container:"
docker compose -f app/connector/my_mysql/compose.mysql.yaml up -d
```

You can open Adminer by visiting: [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

You'll be prompted for the username, password, and database name. Use the values from the `compose.mysql.yaml` above.

### Step 5. Create a table in your MySQL database

```sql title="Next, via Adminer select SQL command from the left-hand nav, then enter the following:"
-- Create the table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL
);

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 25);
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Bob', 30);
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Charlie', 35);
```

You can verify this worked by using Adminer to query all records from the `users` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

### Step 6. Introspect your MySQL database

```sh title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your MySQL database:"
ddn connector introspect my_mysql
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your database's schema in the
`app/connector/my_mysql/configuration.json` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

```sh title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available — and their status — at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_mysql
```

### Step 7. Add your model

```sh title="Now, track the table from your MySQL database as a model in your DDN metadata:"
ddn model add my_mysql "mydb.users"
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `MydbUsers.hml`. The DDN CLI will use this
Hasura Metadata Language file to represent the `users` table from MySQL in your API as a
[model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

### Step 8. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 9. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and MySQL connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 10. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query {
  mydbUsers {
    id
    name
    age
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get the following response:"
{
  "data": {
    "mydbUsers": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 25
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": 30
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Charlie",
        "age": 35
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 11. Iterate on your MySQL schema

```sql title="Via Adminer, add a new table and insert some data to your MySQL database:"
-- Create the posts table
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Insert some seed data
INSERT INTO posts (user_id, title, content) VALUES
  (1, 'My First Post', 'This is Alice\'s first post.'),
  (1, 'Another Post', 'Alice writes again!'),
  (2, 'Bob\'s Post', 'Bob shares his thoughts.'),
  (3, 'Hello World', 'Charlie joins the conversation.');
```

```sql title="Using Adminer, verify this by running the following query:"
-- Fetch all posts with user information
SELECT
  posts.id AS post_id,
  posts.title,
  posts.content,
  posts.created_at,
  users.name AS author
FROM
  posts
JOIN
  users ON posts.user_id = users.id;
```

You should see a list of posts returned with the author's information joined from the `users` table

### Step 12. Refresh your metadata and rebuild your project

:::tip

The following steps are necessary each time you make changes to your **source** schema. This includes, adding,
modifying, or dropping tables.

:::

#### Step 12.1. Re-introspect your data source

```plaintext title="First, bring down your running services:"
CTRL + C
```

```sh title="Run the introspection command again:"
ddn connector introspect my_mysql
```

In `app/connector/my_mysql/configuration.json`, you'll see schema updated to include operations for the `posts` table.
In `app/metadata/my_mysql.hml`, you'll see `mydb.posts` present in the metadata as well.

#### Step 12.2. Update your metadata

```sh title="Add the posts model:"
ddn model add my_mysql "mydb.posts"
```

#### Step 12.3. Create a new build

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

#### Step 12.4. Restart your services

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 13. Query your new build

```graphql title="Head back to your console and query the posts model:"
query GetPosts {
  mydbPosts {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "mydbPosts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is Alice's first post."
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts."
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 14. Create a relationship

```sh title="Since there's already a foreign key on the posts table in MySQL, we can easily add the relationship:"
ddn relationship add my_mysql "mydb.posts"
```

You'll see a new metadata object added to the `app/metadata/MydbPosts.hml` file of kind `Relationship` explaining the
relationship between `posts` and `users`.

### Step 15. Rebuild your project

```sh title="As your metadata has changed, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 16. Query using your relationship

```graphql title="Now, execute a nested query using your relationship:"
query GetPosts {
  mydbPosts {
    id
    title
    content
    mydbUser {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Which should return a result like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "mydbPosts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is Alice's first post.",
        "mydbUser": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 25
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!",
        "mydbUser": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 25
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts.",
        "mydbUser": {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Bob",
          "age": 30
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation.",
        "mydbUser": {
          "id": 3,
          "name": "Charlie",
          "age": 35
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with MySQL! 🎉

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to a local MySQL database.
- You set up metadata to represent your tables and relationships, which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build — essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API — and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- Along the way, you learned how to iterate on your schema and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

Take a look at our MySQL docs to learn more about how to use Hasura DDN with MySQL. Or, if you're ready, get started
with adding [permissions](/auth/permissions/index.mdx) to control access to your API.
