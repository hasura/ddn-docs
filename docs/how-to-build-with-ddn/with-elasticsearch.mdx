# Get Started with Hasura DDN and Elasticsearch

## Overview

This tutorial takes about fifteen minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to an Elasticsearch instance
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

This tutorial assumes you're starting from scratch. We'll use a locally running Elasticsearch instance via Docker and
connect it to Hasura, but you can easily follow the steps if you already have data seeded or are using Elasticsearch's
hosted service; Hasura will never modify your source schema.

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Initialize your Elasticsearch connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_es -i
```

From the dropdown, start typing `elasticsearch` and hit enter to accept the default port. Then, provide the following
values:

**ELASTICSEARCH_URL**

```plaintext
http://local.hasura.dev:9200/
```

**ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME**

```plaintext
elastic
```

**ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD**

```plaintext
elastic
```

For now, you can leave the rest of the values as blanks (or their defaults, if present).

### Step 4. Start the local Elasticsearch container

```sh title="Begin by starting a local Elasticsearch container on port 9200:"
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:9200:9200 -d --name elasticsearch \
  -e ELASTIC_PASSWORD="elastic" \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  -e "xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled=false" \
  -e "xpack.license.self_generated.type=trial" \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.17.1
```

```sh title="Then, add a mapping to the database:"
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/customers/" -u elastic:elastic -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "customer_id": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "name": {
        "type": "text",
        "fields": {
          "keyword": {
            "type": "keyword"
          }
        }
      },
      "email": {
        "type": "keyword",
        "index": true
      },
      "location": {
        "type": "geo_point"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

```sh title="Finally, add some data to the database:"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/_bulk" -u elastic:elastic -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{ "index": { "_index": "customers", "_id": "1" } }
{ "customer_id": "CUST001", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com", "location": { "lat": 40.7128, "lon": -74.0060 } }
{ "index": { "_index": "customers", "_id": "2" } }
{ "customer_id": "CUST002", "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane.smith@example.com", "location": { "lat": 34.0522, "lon": -118.2437 } }
{ "index": { "_index": "customers", "_id": "3" } }
{ "customer_id": "CUST003", "name": "Alice Johnson", "email": "alice.j@example.com", "location": { "lat": 51.5074, "lon": -0.1278 } }
{ "index": { "_index": "customers", "_id": "4" } }
{ "customer_id": "CUST004", "name": "Bob Brown", "email": "bob.brown@example.com", "location": { "lat": 48.8566, "lon": 2.3522 } }
{ "index": { "_index": "customers", "_id": "5" } }
{ "customer_id": "CUST005", "name": "Charlie Davis", "email": "charlie.d@example.com", "location": { "lat": 35.6895, "lon": 139.6917 } }
'
```

```sh title="You can verify the data by running:"
curl --location 'http://localhost:9200/customers/_search' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-u elastic:elastic \
--data '{
  "_source": [
    "_id",
    "name"
  ]
}'
```

### Step 5. Introspect your Elasticsearch database

```sh title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your Elasticsearch database:"
ddn connector introspect my_es
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your database's schema in the
`app/connector/my_es/configuration.json` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

```sh title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available — and their status — at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_es
```

### Step 6. Add your model

```sh title="Now, track the index from your Elasticsearch database as a model in your DDN metadata:"
ddn model add my_es customers
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `Customers.hml`. The DDN CLI will use this
Hasura Metadata Language file to represent the `customers` index from Elasticsearch in your API as a
[model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

:::tip

You can import all the indexes from your Elasticsearch database as models by running `ddn model add my_es "*"`.

:::

### Step 7. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 8. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and Elasticsearch connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 9. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query MyQuery {
  customers {
    email
    name
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get the following response:"
{
  "data": {
    "customers": [
      {
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "name": "John Doe"
      },
      {
        "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
        "name": "Jane Smith"
      },
      {
        "email": "alice.j@example.com",
        "name": "Alice Johnson"
      },
      {
        "email": "bob.brown@example.com",
        "name": "Bob Brown"
      },
      {
        "email": "charlie.d@example.com",
        "name": "Charlie Davis"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 10. Iterate on your Elasticsearch schema

```sh title="Let's add a new index for transactions:"
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/transactions/" -u elastic:elastic -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "transaction_id": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "timestamp": {
        "type": "date",
        "format": "strict_date_optional_time||epoch_millis"
      },
      "customer_id": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "transaction_details": {
        "properties": {
          "item_id": {
            "type": "keyword"
          },
          "item_name": {
            "type": "text",
            "fields": {
              "keyword": {
                "type": "keyword",
                "ignore_above": 256
              }
            }
          },
          "price": {
            "type": "float"
          },
          "quantity": {
            "type": "integer"
          },
          "currency": {
            "type": "keyword"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

```sh title="Add some data to the new index:"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/_bulk" -u elastic:elastic -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{ "index": { "_index": "transactions", "_id": "1" } }
{ "transaction_id": "TXN001", "timestamp": "2024-09-01T12:00:00", "customer_id": "CUST001", "transaction_details": { "item_id": "ITEM001", "item_name": "Laptop", "price": 999.99, "quantity": 1, "currency": "USD" } }
{ "index": { "_index": "transactions", "_id": "2" } }
{ "transaction_id": "TXN002", "timestamp": "2024-09-02T14:30:00", "customer_id": "CUST002", "transaction_details": { "item_id": "ITEM002", "item_name": "Smartphone", "price": 599.99, "quantity": 2, "currency": "USD" } }
{ "index": { "_index": "transactions", "_id": "3" } }
{ "transaction_id": "TXN003", "timestamp": "2024-09-03T09:45:00", "customer_id": "CUST003", "transaction_details": { "item_id": "ITEM003", "item_name": "Tablet", "price": 299.99, "quantity": 1, "currency": "USD" } }
{ "index": { "_index": "transactions", "_id": "4" } }
{ "transaction_id": "TXN004", "timestamp": "2024-09-04T16:15:00", "customer_id": "CUST004", "transaction_details": { "item_id": "ITEM004", "item_name": "Headphones", "price": 199.99, "quantity": 1, "currency": "USD" } }
{ "index": { "_index": "transactions", "_id": "5" } }
{ "transaction_id": "TXN005", "timestamp": "2024-09-05T11:30:00", "customer_id": "CUST005", "transaction_details": { "item_id": "ITEM005", "item_name": "Monitor", "price": 149.99, "quantity": 2, "currency": "USD" } }
'
```

### Step 11. Refresh your metadata and rebuild your project

:::tip

The following steps are necessary each time you make changes to your **source** schema. This includes adding, modifying,
or dropping tables.

:::

#### Step 11.1. Kill your services

Bring down the services by pressing `CTRL+C` in the terminal tab logging their activity.

#### Step 11.2. Re-introspect your data source

```sh title="Run the introspection command again:"
ddn connector introspect my_es
```

In `app/connector/my_es/configuration.json`, you'll see schema updated to include the `transactions` index. In
`app/metadata/my_es.hml`, you'll see `transactions` present in the metadata as well.

#### Step 11.3. Update your metadata

```sh title="Add the transactions index as a model:"
ddn model add my_es transactions
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `Transactions.hml`. The DDN CLI will use this
Hasura Metadata Language file to represent the `transactions` index from Elasticsearch in your API as a
[model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

:::tip

You can import all the indexes from your Elasticsearch database as models by running `ddn model add my_es "*"`.

:::

#### Step 11.4. Create a new build

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

#### Step 11.5 Restart your services

```sh title="Bring everything back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 12. Query your new build

```graphql title="Head back to your console and query the transactions model:"
query MyQuery {
  transactions {
    customerId
    transactionId
    transactionDetails {
      currency
      price
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "transactions": [
      {
        "customerId": "CUST001",
        "transactionId": "TXN001",
        "transactionDetails": [
          {
            "currency": "USD",
            "price": 999.99
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "customerId": "CUST002",
        "transactionId": "TXN002",
        "transactionDetails": [
          {
            "currency": "USD",
            "price": 599.99
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "customerId": "CUST003",
        "transactionId": "TXN003",
        "transactionDetails": [
          {
            "currency": "USD",
            "price": 299.99
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "customerId": "CUST004",
        "transactionId": "TXN004",
        "transactionDetails": [
          {
            "currency": "USD",
            "price": 199.99
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "customerId": "CUST005",
        "transactionId": "TXN005",
        "transactionDetails": [
          {
            "currency": "USD",
            "price": 149.99
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with Elasticsearch! 🎉

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to a local Elasticsearch database.
- You set up metadata to represent your tables and relationships, which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build — essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API — and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- Along the way, you learned how to iterate on your schema and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

Take a look at our Elasticsearch docs to learn more about how to use Hasura DDN with Elasticsearch. Or, if you're ready,
get started with adding [permissions](/auth/permissions/index.mdx) to control access to your API.
