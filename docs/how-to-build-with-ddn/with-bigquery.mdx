# Get Started with Hasura DDN and BigQuery

## Overview

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a Hasura DDN project with Google BigQuery. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to a BigQuery database
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query
- Create relationships
- Mutate data

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

If you don't already have a Google Cloud account this tutorial will guide you through creating one.

You'll also need:

- A Google Cloud service account with appropriate permissions for the project and BigQuery dataset you'll use.
- The service account JSON key file downloaded from Google Cloud Console

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Create a new BigQuery dataset

In the Google Cloud console, navigate to the [BigQuery page](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) and create a new
dataset called `hasura_demo`. You can do so by clicking "Studio" in the left sidebar, then with the three dots button
next to the project name in the "Explorer", selecting "Create data set". Give it an id of `hasura_demo` and click
"Create data set".

Make sure that in "IAM and admin", in "Service accounts", you have a service account with at least the "BigQuery User"
role. Using the "Owner" or "BigQuery Admin" role will cover this role too.

You should also create and download a JSON key file for the service account by clicking on its name and selecting "Keys"
in the navigation menu.

The JSON key file should look like this example:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "project-id",
  "private_key_id": "private-key-id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nprivate-key\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "service-account-email",
  "client_id": "client-id",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/service-account-email"
}
```

### Step 4. Seed your BigQuery database

Create a table in your data set with name `users` by clicking on the `hasura_demo` dataset in the BigQuery console and
then clicking on the `+ Create table` button in the top right. Select `Empty table` and give it a name.

You can use the following schema text definition to create the table in the BigQuery console:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "user_id",
    "type": "INTEGER",
    "mode": "REQUIRED"
  },
  {
    "name": "name",
    "type": "STRING",
    "mode": "NULLABLE"
  },
  {
    "name": "age",
    "type": "INTEGER",
    "mode": "NULLABLE"
  }
]
```

Once created, you can click on the table and the "Query" button to seed the table with some data:

```SQL title="Then, seed the table:"
INSERT INTO hasura_demo.users (user_id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 25), (2, 'Bob', 30), (3, 'Charlie', 35);
```

### Step 5. Configure a service account key file

1. Move your downloaded service account key file to your connector folder:

```sh title="Copy your service account key file to the connector directory:"
mv /path/to/your/key.json app/connector/my_bigquery/key.json
```

2. Configure your JDBC connection string in the connector's environment variable `.env` file. The connection string
   should follow this format:

```plaintext
APP_MY_BIGQUERY_JDBC_URL=jdbc:bigquery://https://www.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2:443;ProjectId=your-project-id;DefaultDataset=your-dataset;OAuthType=0;OAuthServiceAcctEmail=your-service-account-email;OAuthPvtKey=/etc/connector/your-key.json
```

In the connection string make sure to replace:

- `your-project-id` with your Google Cloud project ID
- `your-dataset` with your default BigQuery dataset
- `your-service-account-email` with your service account email
- `your-key.json` must match the name of the file you placed in the connector folder

### Step 6. Initialize your BigQuery connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_bigquery -i
```

From the dropdown, select `hasura/bigquery-jdbc` (you can type to filter the list), and enter the value of the
connection string you just created for the `JDBC_URL` environment variable.

### Step 7. Introspect your BigQuery database

```sh title="Use the CLI to introspect your BigQuery database:"
ddn connector introspect my_bigquery
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your database's schema in the
`app/connector/my_bigquery/configuration.json` file.

```sh title="You can check which resources are available — and their status — at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_bigquery
```

### Step 8. Add your models

```sh title="Track your BigQuery tables as models in your DDN metadata:"
ddn model add my_bigquery users
```

:::tip Add all resources at once

You can add all of your models at once by running:

```sh
ddn model add my_bigquery "*"
```

You can also do the same for commands and relationships.

:::

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find newly-generated files for each table you track. The DDN CLI uses these
Hasura Metadata Language files to represent your BigQuery tables in your API as
[models](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

### Step 9. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 10. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and BigQuery connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 11. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write a query for your table:"
query GetUsers {
  users {
    userId
    name
    age
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "userId": "1",
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": "25"
      },
      {
        "userId": "3",
        "name": "Charlie",
        "age": "35"
      },
      {
        "userId": "2",
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": "30"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 12. Iterate on your BigQuery schema

Add a new table to your BigQuery dataset with the name `posts`. You can use the following schema text definition to
create the table in the console:

```json title="Add a new posts table to your BigQuery dataset:"
[
  {
    "name": "user_id",
    "type": "INTEGER",
    "mode": "REQUIRED"
  },
  {
    "name": "post_id",
    "type": "INTEGER",
    "mode": "REQUIRED"
  },
  {
    "name": "title",
    "type": "STRING",
    "mode": "NULLABLE",
    "maxLength": "255"
  },
  {
    "name": "content",
    "type": "STRING",
    "mode": "NULLABLE"
  }
]
```

Once created, you can click on the table and the "Query" button to seed the table with some data:

```SQL title="Seed the new table:"
INSERT INTO hasura_demo.posts (user_id, post_id, title, content) VALUES
  (1, 1, 'My First Post', 'This is the first post for Alice.'),
  (1, 2, 'Another Post', 'Alice writes again!'),
  (2, 3, 'Bobs Post', 'Bob shares his thoughts.'),
  (3, 4, 'Hello World', 'Charlie joins the conversation.');
```

### Step 13. Refresh your metadata and rebuild your project

:::tip

The following steps are necessary each time you make changes to your **source** schema. This includes, adding,
modifying, or dropping tables.

:::

#### Step 13.1. Re-introspect your data source

```sh title="Run the introspection command again:"
ddn connector introspect my_bigquery
```

In `app/connector/my_bigquery/configuration.json`, you'll see schema updated to include operations for the `posts`
table.

#### Step 13.2. Update your metadata

```sh title="Add the posts model:"
ddn model add my_bigquery posts
```

In `app/metadata/my_bigquery.hml`, you'll see `posts` present in the metadata.

### Step 14. Create a Relationship in your Hasura metadata

Let's also now create a Relationship in our Hasura metdata for between the `users` and `posts` tables.

Manually add the following to the bottom of your `app/metadata/Posts.hml` file. The
[Hasura VS Code LSP extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) can help you with
this.

```yaml title="Add a new relationship to your Hasura metadata:"
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: user
  sourceType: Posts
  target:
    model:
      name: Users
      relationshipType: Object
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: userId
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: userId
```

Since this is added directly to the metadata, you don't need to run any commands to add it from the introspection of the
connector. By building your supergraph you will make it available in your API.

### Step 15. Rebuild your project and restart your services

Bring down the services by pressing `CTRL+C` in the terminal tab logging their activity.

```sh title="As your metadata has changed, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring everything back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

```sh title="Run the console again:"
ddn console --local
```

### Step 16. Run your first query utilizing the relationship

```graphql title="Run your first query with a relationship in the GraphiQL console:"
query GetPostsWithAuthors {
  posts {
    postId
    title
    content
    user {
      age
      name
      userId
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "postId": "1",
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is the first post for Alice.",
        "user": {
          "age": "25",
          "name": "Alice",
          "userId": "1"
        }
      },
      {
        "postId": "2",
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!",
        "user": {
          "age": "25",
          "name": "Alice",
          "userId": "1"
        }
      },
      {
        "postId": "3",
        "title": "Bobs Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts.",
        "user": {
          "age": "30",
          "name": "Bob",
          "userId": "2"
        }
      },
      {
        "postId": "4",
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation.",
        "user": {
          "age": "35",
          "name": "Charlie",
          "userId": "3"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with BigQuery! 🎉

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to a local BigQuery database.
- You set up metadata to represent your tables and relationships, which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build — essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API — and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- You learned how to iterate on your schema and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.
- You added a relationship between your `users` and `posts` tables.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

Take a look at our [BigQuery](/reference/connectors/sqlserver/index.mdx) to learn more about how to use Hasura DDN with
BigQuery. Or, if you're ready, get started with adding [permissions](/reference/metadata-reference/permissions.mdx) to
control access to your API.
