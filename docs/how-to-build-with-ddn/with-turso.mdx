# Get Started with Hasura DDN and Turso

## Overview

This tutorial takes about twenty minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to a Turso-hosted database
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query
- Create relationships
- Mutate data

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

This tutorial assumes you're starting from scratch; you'll connect a hosted Turso instance to Hasura, but you can easily
follow the steps if you already have data seeded. Hasura will never modify your source schema.

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Create and seed a new Turso database

#### Step 3.1. Create a new database

Head to [Turso](https://turso.tech) and create an account if you don't already have one. Then, create a new group and
database using their onboarding wizard.

After you finish creating the database, you'll be able to access it from your [dashboard](https://app.turso.tech/).

#### Step 3.2. Create an auth token

From the database, create an auth token and save it.

#### Step 3.3. Seed the database

```sh title="Replacing the db-name, username, and auth token with your values, run the following command to create your first table and seed it with data:"
curl -L -X POST 'https://<db-name>-<your-username>.turso.io/v2/pipeline' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <auth-token>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "requests": [
        {
          "type": "execute",
          "stmt": {
            "sql": "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT NOT NULL, age INTEGER NOT NULL)"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "execute",
          "stmt": {
            "sql": "INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (\"Alice\", 25)"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "execute",
          "stmt": {
            "sql": "INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (\"Bob\", 30)"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "execute",
          "stmt": {
            "sql": "INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (\"Charlie\", 35)"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "close"
        }
      ]
    }'
```

```sh title="You can then verify this by running the following:"
curl -L -X POST 'https://<db-name>-<your-username>.turso.io/v2/pipeline' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <auth-token>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "requests": [
        {
          "type": "execute",
          "stmt": {
            "sql": "SELECT * FROM users"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "close"
        }
      ]
    }'
```

### Step 4. Initialize your Turso connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_turso -i
```

From the dropdown, select `hasura/turso` (you can type to filter the list), then hit enter to accept the default of all
the options.

You'll be prompted for two environment variables:

| Variable           | Description                                                                                                                                        | Example                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `TURSO_URL`        | The connection string for the Turso database, using `libsql` protocol. You can generate this from the database's overview in your Turso dashboard. | `libsql://dbname-username.turso.io` |
| `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` | The Turso auth token you genreated in the previous step.                                                                                           | `eyJ...`                            |

### Step 5. Introspect your Turso database

```sh title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your Turso database:"
ddn connector introspect my_turso
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your database's schema in the
`app/connector/my_turso/config.json` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

```sh title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available — and their status — at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_turso
```

### Step 6. Add your model

```sh title="Now, track the table from your Turso database as a model in your DDN metadata:"
ddn model add my_turso users
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `Users.hml`. The DDN CLI will use this Hasura
Metadata Language file to represent the `users` table from Turso in your API as a
[model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

### Step 7. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 8. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and Turso connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 9. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    age
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get the following response:"
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 25
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": 30
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Charlie",
        "age": 35
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 10. Iterate on your Turso schema

```sql title="Add a new table and insert some data to your Turso database, taking care to update your values accordingly:"
curl -L -X POST 'https://<db-name>-<your-username>.turso.io/v2/pipeline' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <auth-token>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "requests": [
        {
          "type": "execute",
          "stmt": {
            "sql": "CREATE TABLE posts (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, user_id INTEGER NOT NULL, title TEXT NOT NULL, content TEXT NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE)"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "execute",
          "stmt": {
            "sql": "INSERT INTO posts (user_id, title, content) VALUES (1, \"My First Post\", \"This is Alice'\''s first post.\")"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "execute",
          "stmt": {
            "sql": "INSERT INTO posts (user_id, title, content) VALUES (1, \"Another Post\", \"Alice writes again!\")"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "execute",
          "stmt": {
            "sql": "INSERT INTO posts (user_id, title, content) VALUES (2, \"Bob'\''s Post\", \"Bob shares his thoughts.\")"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "execute",
          "stmt": {
            "sql": "INSERT INTO posts (user_id, title, content) VALUES (3, \"Hello World\", \"Charlie joins the conversation.\")"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "close"
        }
      ]
    }'
```

```sql title="Verify this by running the following query:"
curl -L -X POST 'https://<db-name>-<your-username>.turso.io/v2/pipeline' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <auth-token>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "requests": [
        {
          "type": "execute",
          "stmt": {
            "sql": "SELECT posts.id AS post_id, posts.title, posts.content, posts.created_at, users.name AS author FROM posts JOIN users ON posts.user_id = users.id"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "close"
        }
      ]
    }'
```

You should see a list of posts returned with the author's information joined from the `users` table

### Step 11. Refresh your metadata and rebuild your project

:::tip

The following steps are necessary each time you make changes to your **source** schema. This includes, adding,
modifying, or dropping tables.

:::

#### Step 11.1. Re-introspect your data source

```sh title="Run the introspection command again:"
ddn connector introspect my_turso
```

In `app/connector/my_turso/config.json`, you'll see schema updated to include operations for the `posts` table. In
`app/metadata/my_turso.hml`, you'll see `posts` present in the metadata as well.

#### Step 11.2. Update your metadata

```sh title="Add the posts model:"
ddn model add my_turso "posts"
```

#### Step 11.3. Create a new build

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

#### Step 11.4. Restart your services

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 12. Query your new build

```graphql title="Head back to your console and query the posts model:"
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is Alice's first post."
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts."
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 13. Create a relationship

```sh title="Since there's already a foreign key on the posts table in Turso, we can easily add the relationship:"
ddn relationship add my_turso "posts"
```

You'll see a new metadata object added to the `app/metadata/posts.hml` file of kind `Relationship` explaining the
relationship between `posts` and `users`.

### Step 14. Rebuild your project

```sh title="As your metadata has changed, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 15. Query using your relationship

```graphql title="Now, execute a nested query using your relationship:"
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    id
    title
    content
    user {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Which should return a result like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is Alice's first post.",
        "user": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 25
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!",
        "user": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 25
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts.",
        "user": {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Bob",
          "age": 30
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation.",
        "user": {
          "id": 3,
          "name": "Charlie",
          "age": 35
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 16. Add all commands

We'll track the available operations — for inserting, updating, and deleting — on our `users` and `posts` tables as
commands.

```sh title="Add all available commands:"
ddn command add my_turso "*"
```

You'll see newly-generated metadata files in the `metadata` directory for your connector that represent insert, update,
and delete operations.

```sh title="As your metadata has changed, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 17. Insert new data

```graphql title="Create a new post for Charlie:"
mutation InsertSinglePost {
  insertPostsOne(
    object: {
      content: "I am an expert in Bird Law and I demand satisfaction."
      title: "Charlie has more to say"
      userId: 3
      id: 5
    }
  ) {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}
```

You should see a response that returns your inserted data.

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with Turso! 🎉

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to a local Turso database.
- You set up metadata to represent your tables and relationships, which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build — essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API — and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- Along the way, you learned how to iterate on your schema and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.
- Finally, we looked at how to enable mutations and insert data using your new API.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

Take a look at our Turso docs to learn more about how to use Hasura DDN with Turso. Or, if you're ready, get started
with adding [permissions](/auth/permissions/index.mdx) to control access to your API.
