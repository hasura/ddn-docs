# Get Started with Hasura DDN and Prometheus

## Overview

This tutorial takes about twenty minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to a Prometheus instance
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

This tutorial assumes you're starting from scratch; you'll connect a locally-running Prometheus instance â€” set up to
scrape metrics from itself â€” to Hasura, but you can easily follow the steps if you already have an existing Prometheus
server. Hasura will never modify your source schema.

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Initialize your Prometheus connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_prometheus -i
```

From the dropdown, select `hasura/prometheus` (you can type to filter the list). Then, enter the following connection
string when prompted:

```plaintext
http://local.hasura.dev:9090
```

### Step 4. Start the local Prometheus instance

```sh title="Begin by creating a compose file for the Prometheus server:"
touch app/connector/my_prometheus/compose.prometheus.yaml
```

```yaml title="Then, open the file and add the following:"
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    container_name: prometheus
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    command:
      - "--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml"
```

```sh title="In the same directory, create a Prometheus configuration file:"
touch app/connector/my_prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

```yaml title="Then, open the file and add the following:"
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["local.hasura.dev:9090"]
```

```sh title="Run the container:"
docker compose -f app/connector/my_prometheus/compose.prometheus.yaml up -d
```

You can open Prometheus by visiting: [`http://localhost:9090`](http://localhost:9090). Go ahead and navigate here and
poke around...we'll need some requests against the server for our queries later!

### Step 5. Introspect your Prometheus server

```sh title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your Prometheus server:"
ddn connector introspect my_prometheus
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your Prometheus server's schema in the
`app/connector/my_prometheus/configuration.yaml` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

```sh title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available â€”Â and their status â€” at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_prometheus
```

### Step 6. Add your model

```sh title="Now, let's track a common counter metric as a model in your DDN metadata:"
ddn model add my_prometheus prometheus_http_requests_total
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `PrometheusHttpRequestsTotal.hml`. The DDN CLI
will use this Hasura Metadata Language file to represent the `prometheus_http_requests_total` metric from Prometheus in
your API as a [model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

### Step 7. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 8. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and Prometheus connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 9. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

We'll write a GraphQL query that's the equivalent of this PromQL query:

```plaintext
sum(rate(prometheus_http_requests_total{job="prometheus"}[1m]))
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query GET_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND {
  prometheusHttpRequestsTotal(
    args: { fn: [{ rate: "1m" }, { sum: [] }] }
    where: { timestamp: { _gt: "2025-03-26" }, job: { _eq: "prometheus" } }
  ) {
    timestamp
    value
  }
}
```

:::tip Change the `_gt` value

For the most accurate results, change the date value to a recent date.

:::

```json title="You'll get a response that looks like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "prometheusHttpRequestsTotal": [
      {
        "job": "prometheus",
        "timestamp": 1743004075,
        "value": 0.08889283968176363
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 10. Add another model

```sh title="Add the process_cpu_seconds_total counter metric:"
ddn model add my_prometheus process_cpu_seconds_total
```

In `app/metadata` you'll find a newly-generated file: `ProcessCpuSecondsTotal.hml`. This will be used to expose the
counter metric via your supergraph API.

### Step 11. Rebuild your project

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 12. Query your new build

```graphql title="Head back to your console and query the new model:"
query GET_CPU_PROCESS_TOTAL {
  processCpuSecondsTotal(
    args: { fn: [{ rate: "1m" }, { sum: [] }] }
    where: { timestamp: { _gt: "2025-03-26" }, job: { _eq: "prometheus" } }
  ) {
    timestamp
    value
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response that looks like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "processCpuSecondsTotal": [
      {
        "timestamp": 1743010998,
        "value": 0.002222123461179495
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with Prometheus! ðŸŽ‰

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to a local Prometheus server.
- You set up metadata to represent your counter metrics, which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build â€” essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API â€” and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- Along the way, you learned how to iterate on your schema and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

Take a look at our [Prometheus docs](/reference/connectors/prometheus/index.mdx) to learn more about how to use Hasura
DDN with Prometheus. Or, if you're ready, get started with adding [permissions](/auth/permissions/index.mdx) to control
access to your API.
