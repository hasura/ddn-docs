# Get Started with Hasura DDN and HTTP APIs

## Overview

This tutorial takes about fifteen minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to an existing HTTP API
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

This tutorial assumes you're starting from scratch. We'll connect to the
[`{JSON} Placeholder` API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/); Hasura will never modify your source schema.

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Initialize your HTTP connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_http -i
```

From the dropdown, select `hasura/http` (you can type to filter the list). The HTTP connector will not ask for any
environment variables. Instead, you'll find a configuration file at `app/connector/my_http/config.yaml`.

This configuration file allows you to adjust the settings of your connector and determine which APIs are included; the
`files` array expects an array of configuration files in either YAML or JSON format.

:::info What types of configuration files can I use?

By default, the connector ships with the `{JSON} Placeholder` API's schema included. This is what we'll use in this
guide.

However, you can use any OpenAPI 2 or 3 specification files. A list of common schemas can be found
[here](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-http-recipes/tree/main/recipes).

:::

### Step 4. Introspect your API's schema

```sh title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your API's schema:"
ddn connector introspect my_http
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your database's schema in the
`app/connector/my_http/schema.output.json` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

```sh title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available — and their status — at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_http
```

### Step 5. Add your first command

The HTTP connector exposes each resource in the API's schema as a [command](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx).

```sh title="Let's track a single command from the existing API:"
ddn command add my_http getUsers
```

### Step 6. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 7. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and HTTP connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 8. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query GET_USERS {
  getUsers {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get the following response:"
{
  "data": {
    "getUsers": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Leanne Graham"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Ervin Howell"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Clementine Bauch"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 9. Add another command

```sh title="Let's add the command to query for posts:"
ddn command add my_http getPosts
```

### Step 10. Rebuild your project

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 11. Query your new build

```graphql title="Head back to your console and query the posts:"
query GET_POSTS {
  getPosts {
    id
    userId
    title
    body
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "getPosts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "userId": 1,
        "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
        "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "userId": 1,
        "title": "qui est esse",
        "body": "est rerum tempore vitae\nsequi sint nihil reprehenderit dolor beatae ea dolores neque\nfugiat blanditiis voluptate porro vel nihil molestiae ut reiciendis\nqui aperiam non debitis possimus qui neque nisi nulla"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "userId": 1,
        "title": "ea molestias quasi exercitationem repellat qui ipsa sit aut",
        "body": "et iusto sed quo iure\nvoluptatem occaecati omnis eligendi aut ad\nvoluptatem doloribus vel accusantium quis pariatur\nmolestiae porro eius odio et labore et velit aut"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 12. Create a relationship

In your DDN metadata, you can create [relationships](/reference/metadata-reference/relationships.mdx) between resources
in your API. Below, we'll define a relationship — with the assistance of the
[VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.Hasura) — between `users` and `posts`.

```yaml title="Add the following to the end of the app/connector/my_http/metadata/getUsers.hml file:"
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: posts
  sourceType: User
  target:
    command:
      name: GetPosts
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: id
      target:
        argument:
          argumentName: userId
```

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

```graphql title="Run the following query to return nested data about posts for each user:"
query GET_USERS_AND_POSTS {
  getUsers {
    id
    name
    posts {
      id
      title
      body
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "getUsers": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Leanne Graham",
        "posts": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
            "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto"
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "title": "qui est esse",
            "body": "est rerum tempore vitae\nsequi sint nihil reprehenderit dolor beatae ea dolores neque\nfugiat blanditiis voluptate porro vel nihil molestiae ut reiciendis\nqui aperiam non debitis possimus qui neque nisi nulla"
          },
          ...
        ]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

:::info create relationships to your own data

You can create relationships between resources in your connected HTTP API and data living in other data sources.

:::

### Step 13. Insert data

We can also track existing insert, update, and delete operations available via the API.

```sh title="Let's track this createPost command:"
ddn command add my_http createPost
```

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

```graphql title="Then, run the following mutation:"
mutation INSERT_SINGLE_POST {
  createPost(body: { body: "This is a new post!", title: "New Post" }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "createPost": {
      "id": 101,
      "title": "New Post"
    }
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with the HTTP connector! 🎉

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to the `{JSON} Placeholder` HTTP API.
- You set up metadata to represent your tables and relationships, which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build — essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API — and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- Along the way, you learned how to iterate on your schema and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.
- Finally, we looked at how to enable mutations and insert data using your new API.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

Take a look at our HTTP connector docs to learn more about how to use Hasura DDN with existing HTTP APIs. Or, if you're
ready, get started with adding [permissions](/auth/permissions/index.mdx) to control access to your API.
