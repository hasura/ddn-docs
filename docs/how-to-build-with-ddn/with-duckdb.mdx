# Get Started with Hasura DDN and DuckDB

## Overview

This tutorial takes about twenty minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to a local DuckDB database
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query
- Create relationships

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

This tutorial assumes you're starting from scratch; you'll connect a local DuckDB instance to Hasura, but you can easily
follow the steps if you already have data seeded. Hasura will never modify your source schema.

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Initialize your DuckDB connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_duckdb -i
```

From the dropdown, select `/hasura/duckdb` (you can type to filter the list). Then, enter the following file path:

```plaintext
/etc/connector/data.duckdb
```

:::info Why this path?

When your DuckDB connector starts as a container, its directory in your project gets mounted. This will make the
`data.duckdb` file accessible to the container and the connector. We'll create this file in the next step.

:::

### Step 4. Prepare an initial DuckDB file

:::info Install the DuckDB CLI

You'll need the DuckDB CLI installed on your machine to prepare the database file. You can install it
[here](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/?version=stable&environment=cli&platform=macos&download_method=direct).

:::

```sh itle="Next, from your project's root directory, using the DuckDB CLI run the following:"
echo "
-- Create a sequence since DuckDB doesn't support auto-incrementing
CREATE SEQUENCE users_id_seq;
-- Create the table using the sequence
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT nextval('users_id_seq'),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  age INTEGER NOT NULL
);
-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 25);
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Bob', 30);
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Charlie', 35);
" | duckdb app/connector/my_duckdb/data.duckdb
```

You can verify this worked by running the following command from the project's root to query all records from the
`users` table:

```sh
duckdb app/connector/my_duckdb/data.duckdb "SELECT * FROM users;"
```

### Step 5. Introspect your DuckDB database

```sh title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your DuckDB database:"
ddn connector introspect my_duckdb
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your database's schema in the
`app/connector/my_duckdb/config.json` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

```sh title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available — and their status — at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_duckdb
```

### Step 6. Add your model

```sh title="Now, track the table from your DuckDB database as a model in your DDN metadata:"
ddn model add my_duckdb users
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `Users.hml`. The DDN CLI will use this Hasura
Metadata Language file to represent the `users` table from DuckDB in your API as a
[model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

### Step 7. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 8. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and DuckDB connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 9. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    age
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get the following response:"
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 25
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": 30
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Charlie",
        "age": 35
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 10. Iterate on your DuckDB schema

```sh title="From the root of the project, use the DuckDB CLI to add a new table and insert some data to your DuckDB database:"
echo "
-- Create a sequence for posts
CREATE SEQUENCE posts_id_seq;
-- Create the posts table
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT nextval('posts_id_seq'),
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
-- Insert some seed data
INSERT INTO posts (user_id, title, content) VALUES
  (1, 'My First Post', 'This is Alice''s first post.'),
  (1, 'Another Post', 'Alice writes again!'),
  (2, 'Bob''s Post', 'Bob shares his thoughts.'),
  (3, 'Hello World', 'Charlie joins the conversation.');
" | duckdb app/connector/my_duckdb/data.duckdb
```

```sh title="Verify this by running the following command:"
echo "
-- Fetch all posts with user information
SELECT
  posts.id AS post_id,
  posts.title,
  posts.content,
  posts.created_at,
  users.name AS author
FROM
  posts
JOIN
  users ON posts.user_id = users.id;
" | duckdb app/connector/my_duckdb/data.duckdb
```

You should see a list of posts returned with the author's information joined from the `users` table

### Step 11. Refresh your metadata and rebuild your project

:::tip

The following steps are necessary each time you make changes to your **source** schema. This includes, adding,
modifying, or dropping tables.

:::

#### Step 11.1. Re-introspect your data source

```plaintext title="First, bring down your running services:"
CTRL + C
```

```sh title="Run the introspection command again:"
ddn connector introspect my_duckdb
```

In `app/connector/my_duckdb/config.json`, you'll see schema updated to include operations for the `posts` table. In
`app/metadata/my_duckdb.hml`, you'll see `posts` present in the metadata as well.

#### Step 11.2. Update your metadata

```sh title="Add the posts model:"
ddn model add my_duckdb posts
```

#### Step 11.3. Create a new build

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

#### Step 11.4. Restart your services

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 12. Query your new build

```graphql title="Head back to your console and query the posts model:"
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is Alice's first post."
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts."
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 13. Create a relationship

```yaml title="Find the Posts.hml file in your connector's metadata directory and add the following relationship object to the bottom:"
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: user
  sourceType: Posts
  target:
    model:
      name: Users
      relationshipType: Object
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: userId
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: id
```

This will create a relationship that maps the `userId` for any post to the `id` of a user, allowing for nested queries.

### Step 14. Rebuild your project

```sh title="As your metadata has changed, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 15. Query using your relationship

```graphql title="Now, execute a nested query using your relationship:"
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    id
    title
    content
    user {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Which should return a result like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is Alice's first post.",
        "user": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 25
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!",
        "user": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 25
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts.",
        "user": {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Bob",
          "age": 30
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation.",
        "user": {
          "id": 3,
          "name": "Charlie",
          "age": 35
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with DuckDB! 🎉

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to a local DuckDB database.
- You set up metadata to represent your tables and relationships, which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build — essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API — and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- Along the way, you learned how to iterate on your schema and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

Take a look at our DuckDB docs to learn more about how to use Hasura DDN with DuckDB. Or, if you're ready, get started
with adding [permissions](/auth/permissions/index.mdx) to control access to your API.
