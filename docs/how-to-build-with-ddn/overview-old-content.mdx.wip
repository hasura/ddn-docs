In this guide, you'll learn how you can build an API on various data sources using Hasura DDN. As an experienced
engineer, when building APIs on data sources such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or REST APIs, you understand that a
significant portion of your API is already implicitly defined by the modeling work you've done within these data
sources. The remaining work â€” business logic â€” is what requires you to maintain custom code.

Traditional API frameworks solve this by requiring you to write code and use ORMs to abstract away the data source,
leading to performance debt down the road. Hasura provides a revolutionary way of creating APIs on various data sources
that ensures the highest levels of performance upfront. Hasura helps you automatically maintain an API for parts of your
API that can already be defined by the existing modeling work in your data source, and offers a lightweight and
high-performance way to write business logic wherever required.

Our approach is based on two key principles:

1. **Query compilation that is native to the data source with push-down**: This principle ensures that queries are
   optimized and executed directly within the data source, minimizing overhead and maximizing performance.

2. **Lazy evaluationâ€”only compute what is needed**: By evaluating only the necessary computations, Hasura minimizes
   resource usage and enhances performance efficiency.

This results in an API that your consumers will love because of its standardization and on-demand composability. When
leveraging Hasura's capabilities, your API will approach theoretical optimal performance, as if you wrote a custom,
optimized query for every single API endpoint ðŸš€

## API authoring lifecycle

The API authoring lifecycle with Hasura involves the following steps:

1. **Definition by models and commands in Hasura metadata**: The API is defined through models and commands that are
   stored within Hasura's metadata.

2. **Backing by data source entities, code, or queries**: These models and commands are backed by the underlying data
   source entities, custom code, or native queries.

3. **CLI tooling for easy authoring**: Hasura's CLI makes it easy to author models and commands by introspecting the
   data source, code, or native queries.

By following these steps, you can efficiently create and maintain high-performance APIs on various data sources with
Hasura DDN.

## Modeling basics

Designing your data source to align with your API model is essential for creating efficient and scalable applications.
By working backwards from the desired API, you can structure your data source to optimize for read operations, which is
often the primary use case for most consumers. This approach works well for greenfield applications, but existing data
sources can also be adapted using techniques like views or aggregations.

### Start with the API

1. **Define the API**: Outline the resources, data structures, and relationships needed by your application.
2. **Design the Data Source**: Create tables, collections, entities, or endpoints that map directly to the API model.

### Focus on Reads

- **Optimize for queries**: Design your data source to efficiently handle read operations, as they are typically the
  most frequent.
- **Use indexes**: Ensure that columns or fields used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` clauses are indexed to improve
  performance.
