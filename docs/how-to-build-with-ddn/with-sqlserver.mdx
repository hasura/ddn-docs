# Get Started with Hasura DDN and SQL Server

## Overview

This tutorial takes about twenty minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to a SQL Server database
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query
- Create relationships

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

This tutorial assumes you're starting from scratch; a SQL Server docker image ships with the data connector you'll use
in just a bit to connect a locally-running database to Hasura, but you can easily follow the steps if you already have
data seeded; Hasura will never modify your source schema.

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 4. Start the local SQL Server container

```sh title="Start a SQL Server instance"
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Password123" -p 1433:1433 --name sqlserver -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
```

:::tip Connecting to SQL Server

There are a number of ways to connect to your SQL Server database. Choose the one that best suits your workflow.

1. The [SQL Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql) is available for
   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. [Azure Data Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-studio) for MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

3. The [Go SQLCMD CLI](https://github.com/microsoft/go-sqlcmd) connects to your SQL Server database from the command
   line for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

4. `mssql-tools` CLI:

   3.1. Install
   [mssql-tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup-tools?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=redhat-install)

   3.2. Run the following in a bash shell:

   ```sh
   docker exec -it sqlserver /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P 'Password123' -d 'master' -C
   ```

   3.2.1 The flag `-C` is used to apply the `trust server certificate` set to true. This should only be used for local
   database and not on production databases.

   3.2.2 Each SQL statement in the `mssql-tools` interactive shell needs a `GO` statement at the end for the SQL
   statement to process. For example,

   ```
   SELECT * FROM users;
   GO
   ```

:::

```plaintext title="Connect to the database using the connection string:"
Server=localhost,1433;Database=master;Uid=sa;Password=Password123;TrustServerCertificate=true
```

```SQL title="Create a table in the database:"
CREATE TABLE users (user_id int primary key, name varchar(255), age int);
```

```SQL title="Then, seed the table:"
INSERT INTO users (user_id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 25), (2, 'Bob', 30), (3, 'Charlie', 35);
```

```SQL title="You can verify this by running:"
SELECT * FROM users;
```

You should see a list of users returned.

### Step 3. Initialize your SQL Server connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_sqlserver -i
```

From the dropdown, start typing `sqlserver` and hit enter to accept the default port. Then, provide the following
values:

**Connection string**

The connection string format will be in the format
`Server=<hostname>,<port>;Database=<database>;Uid=<username>;Password=<password>` and so is as follows:

```plaintext
Server=localhost,1433;Database=master;Uid=sa;Password=Password123;TrustServerCertificate=true
```

:::warning Certificate security

`TrustServerCertificate=true` should only be added for local databases.

:::

### Step 5. Introspect your SQL Server database

```sh title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your SQL Server database:"
ddn connector introspect my_sqlserver
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your database's schema in the
`app/connector/my_sqlserver/configuration.json` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

```sh title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available — and their status — at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_sqlserver
```

### Step 6. Add your model

```sh title="Now, track the table from your SQL Server database as a model in your DDN metadata:"
ddn model add my_sqlserver users
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `Users.hml`. The DDN CLI will use this Hasura
Metadata Language file to represent the `users` table from SQL Server in your API as a
[model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

:::tip

To track all available models in the dababase, run:

```sh
ddn model add my_sqlserver "*"
```

:::

### Step 7. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 8. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and SQL Server connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 9. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query {
  users {
    userId
    name
    age
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get the following response:"
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "userId": 1,
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 25
      },
      {
        "userId": 2,
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": 30
      },
      {
        "userId": 3,
        "name": "Charlie",
        "age": 35
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 10. Iterate on your SQL Server schema

```sh title="Let's add a new table for posts:"
CREATE TABLE posts (
  user_id int,
  post_id int primary key,
  title varchar(255),
  content varchar(255)
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
```

```sh title="Then, seed it:"
INSERT INTO posts (user_id, post_id, title, content) VALUES
  (1, 1, 'My First Post', 'This is Alice''s first post.'),
  (1, 2, 'Another Post', 'Alice writes again!'),
  (2, 3, 'Bob''s Post', 'Bob shares his thoughts.'),
  (3, 4, 'Hello World', 'Charlie joins the conversation.');
```

```sh title="Finally, we can check the posts were generated:"
-- Fetch all posts with user information
SELECT
  posts.post_id,
  posts.title,
  posts.content,
  users.name AS author
FROM
  posts
JOIN
  users ON posts.user_id = users.user_id;
```

### Step 11. Refresh your metadata and rebuild your project

:::tip

The following steps are necessary each time you make changes to your **source** schema. This includes, adding,
modifying, or dropping tables.

:::

#### Step 11.1. Re-introspect your data source

```sh title="Run the introspection command again:"
ddn connector introspect my_sqlserver
```

In `app/connector/my_sqlserver/configuration.json`, you'll see schema updated to include operations for the `posts`
table. In `app/metadata/my_sqlserver.hml`, you'll see `posts` present in the metadata as well.

#### Step 11.2. Update your metadata

```sh title="Add the posts model:"
ddn model add my_sqlserver posts
```

#### Step 11.3. Kill your services

Bring down the services by pressing `CTRL+C` in the terminal tab logging their activity.

#### Step 11.4. Create a new build

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

#### Step 11.5 Restart your services

```sh title="Bring everything back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 12. Query your new build

```graphql title="Head back to your console and query the posts model:"
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    userId
    postId
    title
    content
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "userId": 1,
        "postId": 1,
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is Alice's first post."
      },
      {
        "userId": 1,
        "postId": 2,
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!"
      },
      {
        "userId": 2,
        "postId": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts."
      },
      {
        "userId": 3,
        "postId": 4,
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 13. Create a relationship

```sh title="Since there's already a foreign key on the posts table in SQL Server, we can easily add the relationship:"
ddn relationship add my_sqlserver "posts"
```

You'll see a new metadata object added to the `app/metadata/posts.hml` file of kind `Relationship` explaining the
relationship between `posts` and `users`.

### Step 14. Rebuild your project

Bring down the services by pressing `CTRL+C` in the terminal tab logging their activity.

```sh title="As your metadata has changed, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring everything back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 15. Query using your relationship

```graphql title="Now, execute a nested query using your relationship:"
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    postId
    title
    content
    user {
      userId
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Which should return a result like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "postId": 1,
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is Alice's first post.",
        "user": {
          "userId": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 25
        }
      },
      {
        "postId": 2,
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!",
        "user": {
          "userId": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 25
        }
      },
      {
        "postId": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts.",
        "user": {
          "userId": 2,
          "name": "Bob",
          "age": 30
        }
      },
      {
        "postId": 4,
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation.",
        "user": {
          "userId": 3,
          "name": "Charlie",
          "age": 35
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with SQL Server! 🎉

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to a local SQL Server database.
- You set up metadata to represent your tables and relationships, which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build — essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API — and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- Along the way, you learned how to iterate on your schema and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

Take a look at our SQL Server docs to learn more about how to use Hasura DDN with SQL Server. Or, if you're ready, get
started with adding [permissions](/reference/metadata-reference/permissions.mdx) to control access to your API.
