# Get Started with Hasura DDN and Qdrant

## Overview

This tutorial takes about twenty minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to a Qdrant-hosted vector database
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query
- Mutate data

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

This tutorial assumes you're starting from scratch; you'll connect a hosted Qdrant instance to Hasura, but you can
easily follow the steps if you already have data seeded. Hasura will never modify your source schema.

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Create and seed a new Qdrant database

Head to [Qdrant](https://cloud.qdrant.io) and create an account if you don't already have one. Then, create a new
cluster.

Qdrant will share an API key immediately after the cluster is provisioned; go ahead and copy this down as you'll need it
in the following steps.

From your cluster's dashboard, choose the `Load Sample Data` option. Follow the steps outlined by Qdrant which allow you
to execute and insert data directly via their UI. You’ll finish setup when you've gotten through the instructions for
implementing multitenancy. This will give you upwards of eight collections to play with.

### Step 4. Initialize your Qdrant connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_qdrant -i
```

From the dropdown, select `hasura/qdrant` (you can type to filter the list), then hit enter to accept the default of all
the options.

You'll be prompted for two environment variables:

| Variable         | Description                                                                                                                                          | Example                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `QDRANT_URL`     | The connection string for the Qdrant database, including the port. You can generate this by selecting `Connect` under the Cluster in your dashboard. | `https://<cluster-id>.<region>.<host>:<port>` |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | The Qdrant API key presented to you when the cluster was provisioned.                                                                                | `eyJ...`                                      |

### Step 5. Introspect your Qdrant database

```sh title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your Qdrant database:"
ddn connector introspect my_qdrant
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your database's schema in the
`app/connector/my_qdrant/config.json` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

```sh title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available — and their status — at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_qdrant
```

If you run this command, you'll see there are several models from the sample data available; additionally, we'll see a
set of commands.

### Step 6. Add your first model

```sh title="Let's track the terraforming collection as a model:"
ddn models add my_qdrant "terraforming"
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `Terraforming.hml`. The DDN CLI will use this
Hasura Metadata Language file to represent the `terraforming` collection from Qdrant in your API as a
[model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

### Step 7. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 8. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and Qdrant connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 9. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query GET_TERRAFORMING_DATA {
  terraforming(args: {}) {
    id
    land
    color
    humidity
    life
    vector
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get the following response:"
{
  "data": {
    "terraforming": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "land": "forest",
        "color": "green",
        "humidity": 40,
        "life": true,
        "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "land": "lake",
        "color": "blue",
        "humidity": 100,
        "life": true,
        "vector": [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "land": "steppe",
        "color": "green",
        "humidity": 25,
        "life": false,
        "vector": [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6]
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "land": "desert",
        "color": "red",
        "humidity": 5,
        "life": false,
        "vector": [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7]
      },
      {
        "id": 5,
        "land": "marsh",
        "color": "black",
        "humidity": 90,
        "life": true,
        "vector": [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8]
      },
      {
        "id": 6,
        "land": "cavern",
        "color": "black",
        "humidity": 15,
        "life": false,
        "vector": [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also utilize vectors to perform similarity searches and even limit the number of results.

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query GET_TERRAFORMING_DATA_BASED_ON_VECTORS {
  terraforming(args: { search: { vector: [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8], scoreThreshold: 0.1 } }, limit: 2) {
    id
    land
    color
    humidity
    life
    vector
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get the following response:"
{
  "data": {
    "terraforming": [
      {
        "id": 6,
        "land": "cavern",
        "color": "black",
        "humidity": 15,
        "life": false,
        "vector": [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
      },
      {
        "id": 5,
        "land": "marsh",
        "color": "black",
        "humidity": 90,
        "life": true,
        "vector": [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 10. Iterate on your API

#### Step 10.1. Add more resources

Our sample data set contains a number of different collections; let's add them all.

```sh title="Add the remaining collections as models:"
ddn model add my_qdrant "*"
```

#### Step 10.2. Create a new build

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

#### Step 10.3. Restart your services

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 11. Query your new build

```graphql title="Head back to your console and query the dinosaurs model:"
query GET_JOHN_HAMMOND {
  dinosaurs(args: {}) {
    id
    dinosaur
    diet
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "dinosaurs": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "dinosaur": "t-rex",
        "diet": [
          {
            "food": "leaves",
            "likes": false
          },
          {
            "food": "meat",
            "likes": true
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "dinosaur": "diplodocus",
        "diet": [
          {
            "food": "leaves",
            "likes": true
          },
          {
            "food": "meat",
            "likes": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 12. Add all commands

We'll track the available operations — for inserting, updating, and deleting — on our collections as commands.

```sh title="Add all available commands:"
ddn command add my_qdrant "*"
```

You'll see newly-generated metadata files in the `metadata` directory for your connector that represent insert, update,
and delete operations.

```sh title="As your metadata has changed, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 13. Update existing data

```graphql title="Let's update the t-rex listing:"
mutation MAKE_HIM_KING {
  updateDinosaursOne(object: { id: 1, vector: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], dinosaur: "T-Rex" })
}
```

You should see a response that alerts you to the operation being completed successfully.

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with Qdrant! 🎉

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to a local Qdrant database.
- You set up metadata to represent your collections, which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build — essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API — and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- Along the way, you learned how to iterate on your API and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.
- Finally, we looked at how to enable mutations and modify data using your new API.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

Take a look at our Qdrant docs to learn more about how to use Hasura DDN with Qdrant. Or, if you're ready, get started
with adding [permissions](/auth/permissions/index.mdx) to control access to your API.
