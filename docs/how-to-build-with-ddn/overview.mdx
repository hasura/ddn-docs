# Basics

## Introduction

Hasura is a powerful-yet-simple-to-create API. Each tutorial in this section will guide you through creating your first
Hasura DDN API on top of your preferred data source.

### You have data

Data is a broad term. What's our definition? It can be anything. No, really: anything.

We realize that data lives in a variety of places—relational databases, non-relational databases, vector stores, OLAP,
OLTP, and even generated on-the-fly by your functions...and you probably want to access all of it from a single
endpoint.

### You connect it to Hasura

Regardless of where your data lives, you'll connect it to your API using a **native data connector**, or data connector
for short. These connectors will introspect your data sources and generate metadata that Hasura DDN will use to generate
your API.

### You configure your API in metadata

This **semantic metadata layer** is written as Hasura Metadata Language (HML), which is an extension of YAML. You can
use the DDN CLI and your text editor to fine-tune and configure the API to your liking; this includes easily creating
metadata objects for permissions, relationships, configuring authentication, etc.

### You serve the API

When your metadata is to your liking, you'll create an immutable build — which serves as a snapshot of your API at that
point in time — and serve it. You can then use the **console** — Hasura's GUI — or a client application to interact with
your GraphQL API.

You can serve this API locally during development for testing and iteration, on Hasura DDN for scalability and ease of
use, or on your own infrastructure if you need complete control and customization.
