# Basics

## Introduction

Hasura DDN enables a powerful, yet simple-to-create API on all your data. Each tutorial in this section will guide you
through creating your first Hasura DDN API on top of your preferred data source. First, let's go over the broad stokes
of how it works.

### You have data

Your data can live in a variety of places - relational or non-relational databases, OLAP or OLTP databases, vector
stores, third-party services, or output by your code. With Hasura you can access all of it from a single API endpoint.

### You connect it to Hasura

Regardless of where your data lives, you'll connect it to your API using a **native data connector**. These connectors
will introspect your data sources and generate metadata that Hasura DDN will use to build your API.

### You configure your API in metadata

This **semantic metadata layer** is written as Hasura Metadata Language (HML), which is an extension of YAML. You can
use the DDN CLI and your text editor to fine-tune and configure the API to your liking; this includes easily creating
metadata objects for permissions, relationships, configuring authentication, etc.

### You serve the API

To convert your metadata into something that you can query, you'll create a build - an immutable snapshot of your API at
that point in time which the Hasura Engine can run and serve. You can then use the **console** - Hasura's GUI - to query
and analyze your GraphQL API, or integrate it with your client apps.

You can serve this API locally during development for testing and iteration, on Hasura DDN for scalability and ease of
use, or on your own infrastructure if you need complete control and customization.
