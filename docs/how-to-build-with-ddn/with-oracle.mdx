# Get Started with Hasura DDN and Oracle

## Overview

This tutorial takes about twenty minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to an Oracle database
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query
- Create relationships

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

This tutorial assumes you're starting from scratch. We'll use an AWS instance of Oracle and connect it to Hasura, but
you can easily follow the steps if you already have data seeded; Hasura will never modify your source schema.

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Initialize your Oracle connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_oracle -i
```

From the dropdown, start typing `oracle` and hit enter to accept the default port. Then, provide the following
values:

**JDBC URL**

```plaintext
jdbc:oracle:thin:@//127.0.0.53:1521/XE?user=SYS&password=mypassword
```

For Schemas, hit enter to use the databse provided in the JDBC URL.

### Step 4. Start the local Oracle container

```sh title="Begin by creating a compose file for the ClickHouse service:"
touch app/connector/my_oracle/compose.oracle.yaml
```

```yaml title="Then, open the file and add the following:"
services:
  oracle:
    image: gvenzl/oracle-xe:21.3.0-slim
    container_name: oracle-server
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "1521:1521"
    environment:
      ORACLE_PASSWORD: mypassword
      ORACLE_DATABASE: XE
```

```sh title="Run the container:"
docker compose -f app/connector/my_oracle/compose.oracle.yaml up -d
```

```sh title="Use the SQL*PLUS shell to start the SQL prompt:"
docker exec -it oracle-server sqlplus sys/mypassword@localhost:1521/XE as sysdba
```

```SQL title="Create a table in the databse:"
CREATE TABLE users (user_id Number NOT NULL, name Varchar2(45) NOT NULL, age Number NOT NULL);
```

```SQL title="Then, seed the table:"
INSERT ALL
   INTO users (user_id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 25)
   INTO users (user_id, name, age) VALUES (2, 'Bob', 30)
   INTO users (user_id, name, age) VALUES (3, 'Charlie', 35)
SELECT 1 FROM DUAL;
```

```SQL title="You can verify this by running:"
SELECT * FROM users;
```

You should see a list of users returned.

### Step 4. Introspect your Oracle database

```sh title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your Oracle database:"
ddn connector introspect my_oracle
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your database's schema in the
`app/connector/my_oracle/configuration.json` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

```sh title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available — and their status — at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_oracle
```

### Step 5. Add your model

```sh title="Now, track the table from your Oracle database as a model in your DDN metadata:"
ddn models add my_oracle users
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `Users.hml`. The DDN CLI will use this Hasura
Metadata Language file to represent the `users` table from Oracle in your API as a
[model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

### Step 6. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 7. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and Oracle connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 8. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query {
  users {
    userId
    name
    age
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get the following response:"
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "userId": 1,
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 25
      },
      {
        "userId": 2,
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": 30
      },
      {
        "userId": 3,
        "name": "Charlie",
        "age": 35
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 9. Iterate on your Oracle schema

```SQL title="Let's add a new table for posts:"
CREATE TABLE posts (
        user_id Number,
        post_id Number,
        title Varchar2(45),
        content Varchar2(45)
    );
```

```SQL title="Then, seed it:"
INSERT ALL
   INTO posts (user_id, post_id, title, content) VALUES (1, 1, 'My First Post', 'This is Alice''s first post.')
   INTO posts (user_id, post_id, title, content) VALUES (1, 2, 'Another Post', 'Alice writes again!')
   INTO posts (user_id, post_id, title, content) VALUES (2, 3, 'Bob''s Post', 'Bob shares his thoughts.')
   INTO posts (user_id, post_id, title, content) VALUES (3, 4, 'Hello World', 'Charlie joins the conversation.')
SELECT 1 FROM DUAL;
```

```SQL title="Finally, we can check the posts were generated:"
SELECT * FROM posts;
```

### Step 10. Refresh your metadata and rebuild your project

:::tip

The following steps are necessary each time you make changes to your **source** schema. This includes, adding,
modifying, or dropping tables.

:::

#### Step 10.1. Re-introspect your data source

```sh title="Run the introspection command again:"
ddn connector introspect my_oracle
```

In `app/connector/my_oracle/configuration.json`, you'll see schema updated to include operations for the `posts` table. In
`app/metadata/my_oracle.hml`, you'll see `posts` present in the metadata as well.

#### Step 10.2. Update your metadata

```sh title="Add the posts model:"
ddn model add my_oracle posts
```

#### Step 10.3. Kill your services

Bring down the services by pressing `CTRL+C` in the terminal tab logging their activity.

#### Step 10.4. Create a new build

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

#### Step 10.5 Restart your services

```sh title="Bring everything back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 11. Query your new build

```graphql title="Head back to your console and query the posts model:"
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    userId
    postId
    title
    content
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "userId": 1,
        "postId": 1,
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is Alice's first post."
      },
      {
        "userId": 1,
        "postId": 2,
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!"
      },
      {
        "userId": 2,
        "postId": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts."
      },
      {
        "userId": 3,
        "postId": 4,
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 12. Create a relationship

```yaml title="Open the Posts.hml file and add the following to the end:"
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: user
  sourceType: Posts
  target:
    model:
      name: Users
      relationshipType: Object
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: userId
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: userId
```

:::tip LSP-Assisted authoring is available

We've created an extension for VS Code that leverages LSP to make authoring these metadata objects easier. Check it out
[here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura).

:::

### Step 13. Rebuild your project

Bring down the services by pressing `CTRL+C` in the terminal tab logging their activity.

```sh title="As your metadata has changed, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring everything back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 15. Query using your relationship

```graphql title="Now, execute a nested query using your relationship:"
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    postId
    title
    content
    user {
      userId
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Which should return a result like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "postId": 1,
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is Alice's first post.",
        "user": {
          "userId": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 25
        }
      },
      {
        "postId": 2,
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!",
        "user": {
          "userId": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 25
        }
      },
      {
        "postId": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts.",
        "user": {
          "userId": 2,
          "name": "Bob",
          "age": 30
        }
      },
      {
        "postId": 4,
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation.",
        "user": {
          "userId": 3,
          "name": "Charlie",
          "age": 35
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with Oracle! 🎉

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to an Oracle database.
- You set up metadata to represent your tables and relationships, which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build — essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API — and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- Along the way, you learned how to iterate on your schema and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

Take a look at our Oracle docs to learn more about how to use Hasura DDN with Oracle. Or, if you're ready, get
started with adding [permissions](/reference/metadata-reference/permissions.mdx) to control access to your API.
