# Get Started with Hasura DDN and Stripe

## Overview

This tutorial takes about ten minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to a Stripe account
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

This tutorial assumes you're starting with an existing [Stripe account](https://stripe.com/) which has some
[products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) and [checkout sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions).
Though, by the end, you'll be able to query any information stored in Stripe.

Hasura will never modify your source schema.

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Initialize your Stripe connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_stripe -i
```

From the dropdown, select `hasura/stripe` (you can type to filter the list), then hit enter to accept the default of all
the options.

You'll be prompted for an environment variable:

| Variable                   | Description                                                                                                                         | Example                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `STRIPE_BEARER_AUTH_TOKEN` | A **secret** key for your account, retrievable from your [API Keys dashboard in Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys). | `sk_<test\|prod>_<unique_identifier>` |

### Step 4. Introspect your Stripe account

```sh title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your Stripe account:"
ddn connector introspect my_stripe
```

After running this, you should see a representation of the Stripe API's schema in the `app/metadata/my_stripe.hml` file;
you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

Under the hood, the Stripe connector utilizes the [`ndc-http` connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-http) via
[Stripe's OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/stripe/openapi). This ensures you can incorporate any resources available via
Stripe's REST API into your supergraph.

```sh title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available — and their status — at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_stripe
```

### Step 5. Add your command

```sh title="Let's start by tracking the GetProducts endpoint from Stripe's API:"
ddn command add my_stripe GetProducts
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `GetProducts.hml`. The DDN CLI will use this
Hasura Metadata Language file to represent the `GetProducts` endpoint from Stripe in your API as a
[command](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx).

### Step 6. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 7. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and Stripe connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 8. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query GET_ALL_PRODUCTS {
  getProducts {
    data {
      id
      name
      description
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response listing all of your products. For example:"
{
  "data": {
    "getProducts": {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "3bef8a40-3c33-11ee-bb29-070df467ec94",
          "name": "Tee",
          "description": "A great t-shirt!"
        },
        {
          "id": "e0a70b16-65b6-11ed-8788-8fa2504d64a3",
          "name": "Sticker Sheet",
          "description": "Who doesn't love stickers??"
        },
        {
          "id": "a44eda7c-65b6-11ed-997b-53b5bdb7117e",
          "name": "Hasuras in The Cloud Tee",
          "description": "The cloud for your cloud."
        },
        {
          "id": "8aa93f86-65b6-11ed-901c-f320d4e17bb2",
          "name": "Dark Furry Logo Tee",
          "description": "Furry for furries."
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 9. Add another command

```sh title="Add the GetCheckoutSessions command:"
ddn command add my_stripe GetCheckoutSessions
```

In `app/metadata` you'll find a newly-generated file: `GetCheckoutSessions.hml`. This will be used to expose customer
checkout sessions and their related information via your supergraph API.

### Step 10. Rebuild your project

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 11. Query your new build

```graphql title="Head back to your console and query the GetCheckoutSessions endpoint:"
query GET_CHECKOUT_SESSIONS {
  getCheckoutSessions {
    data {
      id
      amountTotal
      customerDetails {
        name
        email
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Because of the schema of Stripe's API, you'll see results like this, which contain nested information, such as customer details:"
{
  "data": {
    "getCheckoutSessions": {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "cs_test_<unique_identifier>",
          "amountTotal": 1000,
          "customerDetails": {
            "name": "Rob",
            "email": "robdemo@hasura.io"
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "cs_test_<unique_identifier>",
          "amountTotal": 1000,
          "customerDetails": {
            "name": "Sandeep",
            "email": "sandeepdemo@hasura.io"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::info create relationships to your own data

You can create relationships between resources in your Stripe account and data living in other data sources.

As an example, you may have a PostgreSQL database with a `users` model exposed and which contains an `email` field. This
field can be used to create a [relationship](/reference/metadata-reference/relationships.mdx) between the `users` model
and a `CheckoutSession` (or any other resource that utilizes a unique `email`) to return information across your sources
in a single query.

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with Stripe! 🎉

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to an existing Stripe account.
- You set up metadata to represent the various endpoints on Stripe's API, which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build — essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API — and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- Along the way, you learned how to iterate on your schema and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data Stripe data to other data sources, empowering you to iterate and
scale with confidence. Great work!

The Stripe connector also supports mutations; you can create, update, or delete products; create new checkout sessions;
refund payments; etc.

Take a look at our Stripe docs to learn more about how to use Hasura DDN with [Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/). Or, if
you're ready, get started with adding [permissions](/auth/permissions/index.mdx) to control access to your API.
