# Get Started with Hasura DDN and an existing GraphQL API

## Overview

This tutorial takes about twenty minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to an existing GraphQL API
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

This tutorial assumes you're starting with an existing GraphQL API to and connecting it to Hasura; for ease, we'll use
the [SpaceX API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/SpaceX-pxxbxen/variant/current/home). Hasura will never modify
your source schema.

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Initialize your GraphQL connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_graphql -i
```

From the dropdown, select `hasura/graphql` (you can type to filter the list), then hit enter to accept the default of
all the options.

You'll be prompted for the API's endpoint:

| Variable           | Description                                | Example                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` | The GraphQL endpoint for the existing API. | `https://spacex-production.up.railway.app/` |

Enter the example endpoint above.

:::info You can use different configurations for introspection and query execution

This environment variable will be written to the connector's `configuration.json` file. If you'd like to use a different
configuration for introspection vs. executing requests, see the configuration docs
[here](/reference/connectors/graphql/configuration.mdx).

:::

### Step 4. Introspect your GraphQL endpoint

```sh title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your GraphQL endpoint:"
ddn connector introspect my_graphql
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your GraphQL API's schema in the
`app/connector/my_graphql/schema.graphql` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

```sh title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available â€”Â and their status â€” at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_graphql
```

### Step 5. Add your first command

The GraphQL connector exposes various top-level fields in an existing GraphQL API as
[commands](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx).

```sh title="Let's track single command from the existing API:"
ddn command add my_graphql launches
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `Launches.hml`. The DDN CLI will use this
Hasura Metadata Language file to represent the `launches` type from your GraphQL API in your supergraph as a command.

### Step 6. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 7. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and GraphQL connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 8. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query GET_LAUNCH_DATA {
  launches {
    id
    missionName
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get the following response:"
{
  "data": {
    "launches": [
      {
        "id": "5eb87cd9ffd86e000604b32a",
        "missionName": "FalconSat"
      },
      {
        "id": "5eb87cdaffd86e000604b32b",
        "missionName": "DemoSat"
      },
      {
        "id": "5eb87cdbffd86e000604b32c",
        "missionName": "Trailblazer"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 9. Add another command

```sh title="Let's add the command to query for rockets:"
ddn command add my_graphql rockets
```

In `app/connector/my_graphql/configuration.json`, you'll see schema updated to include operations for the `rockets`
GraphQL endpoint. In `app/metadata/my_graphql.hml`, you'll see `rockets` present in the metadata as well.

### Step 10. Rebuild your project

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 11. Query your new build

```graphql title="Head back to your console and query the rockets:"
query GET_ROCKETS_DATA {
  rockets {
    name
    costPerLaunch
    description
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "rockets": [
      {
        "name": "Falcon 1",
        "costPerLaunch": 6700000,
        "description": "The Falcon 1 was an expendable launch system privately developed and manufactured by SpaceX during 2006-2009. On 28 September 2008, Falcon 1 became the first privately-developed liquid-fuel launch vehicle to go into orbit around the Earth."
      },
      {
        "name": "Falcon 9",
        "costPerLaunch": 50000000,
        "description": "Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport of satellites and the Dragon spacecraft into orbit."
      }
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

:::info create relationships to your own data

You can create relationships between resources in your connected GraphQL endpoint and data living in other data sources.

As an example, you may have a PostgreSQL database with a `booster` [model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx)
exposed and which contains a unique `id` field. This field can be used to create a
[relationship](/reference/metadata-reference/relationships.mdx) between the `rockets` command and a `booster` in your
database (or any other resource that utilizes a unique `id`) to return information across your sources in a single
query.

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with an external GraphQL API! ðŸŽ‰

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to an existing GraphQL API.
- You set up metadata to represent your existing GraphQL schema and how it integrates with your local Hasura project,
  which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build â€” essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API â€” and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- Along the way, you learned how to iterate on your schema and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

The GraphQL connector also supports mutations; you can create, update, or delete resources using your API.

Take a look at our [GraphQL connector docs](/reference/connectors/graphql/index.mdx) to learn more about how to use
Hasura DDN with existing GraphQL APIs. Or, if you're ready, get started with adding
[permissions](/auth/permissions/index.mdx) to control access to your API.
