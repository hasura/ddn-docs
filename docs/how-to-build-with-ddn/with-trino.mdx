# Get Started with Hasura DDN and Trino

## Overview

This tutorial takes about twenty minutes to complete. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a new Hasura DDN project
- Connect it to a Trino instance, backed by a locally-running PostgreSQL database
- Generate Hasura metadata
- Create a build
- Run your first query
- Create relationships

Additionally, we'll familiarize you with the steps and workflows necessary to iterate on your API.

This tutorial assumes you're starting from scratch, but you can easily follow the steps if you already have data seeded;
Hasura will never modify your source schema.

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Initialize your Trino connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_trino -i
```

From the dropdown, select `hasura/trino` (you can type to filter the list). Then, enter the following JDBC URL:

```plaintext
jdbc:trino://local.hasura.dev:8080/postgres/public?user=myuser
```

This will allow your connector to connect to the PostgreSQL instance integrated with the Trino server you'll run
locally.

### Step 4. Create the containers with Trino and PostgreSQL

```sh title="Begin by creating a compose file for the Trino service:"
touch app/connector/my_trino/compose.trino.yaml
```

```yaml title="Then, open the file and add the following:"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: myuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U myuser"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  trino:
    image: trinodb/trino:latest
    container_name: trino
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    command: |
      /bin/sh -c "
      mkdir -p /etc/trino/catalog &&
      echo 'connector.name=postgresql' > /etc/trino/catalog/postgres.properties &&
      echo 'connection-url=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/mydb' >> /etc/trino/catalog/postgres.properties &&
      echo 'connection-user=myuser' >> /etc/trino/catalog/postgres.properties &&
      echo 'connection-password=mypassword' >> /etc/trino/catalog/postgres.properties &&
      /usr/lib/trino/bin/run-trino
      "
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/v1/info"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

```sh title="Run the container:"
docker compose -f app/connector/my_trino/compose.trino.yaml up -d
```

The Trino container will start; you can access the UI — which will give you general information about your clusters —
here: [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/).

### Step 5. Create a table in your PostgreSQL database

```sh title="Enter the PostgreSQL container:"
docker exec -it postgres psql -U myuser -d mydb
```

```sql title="Then, create your first table and seed the database:"
--- Create the table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL
);

--- Insert some data
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 25);
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Bob', 30);
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Charlie', 35);
```

You can verify this worked by querying the users table directly in the psql session:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

### Step 6. Introspect your Trino instance

```sh title="Next, in a new tab, use the CLI to introspect your Trino database:"
ddn connector introspect my_trino
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your database's schema in the
`app/connector/my_trino/configuration.json` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

```sh title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available — and their status — at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_trino
```

### Step 7. Add your model

```sh title="Now, track the table from Trino server as a model in your DDN metadata:"
ddn model add my_trino users
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `Users.hml`. The DDN CLI will use this Hasura
Metadata Language file to represent the `users` table from Trino in your API as a
[model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

### Step 8. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 9. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and Trino connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 10. Run your first query

```sh title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="In the GraphiQL explorer of the console, write this query:"
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    age
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get the following response:"
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 25
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": 30
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Charlie",
        "age": 35
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 11. Iterate on your Trino schema

```sh title="Let's re-enter the PostgreSQL container:"
docker exec -it postgres psql -U myuser -d mydb
```

```sql title="Then, add a new table for posts:"
-- Create the posts table
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert some seed data
INSERT INTO posts (user_id, title, content) VALUES
  (1, 'My First Post', 'This is Alice''s first post.'),
  (1, 'Another Post', 'Alice writes again!'),
  (2, 'Bob''s Post', 'Bob shares his thoughts.'),
  (3, 'Hello World', 'Charlie joins the conversation.');
```

```sql title="To verify this, query the joined data:"
SELECT
  posts.id AS post_id,
  posts.title,
  posts.content,
  posts.created_at,
  users.name AS author
FROM
  posts
JOIN
  users ON posts.user_id = users.id;
```

You should see a list of posts returned with the author's information joined from the `users` table

### Step 12. Refresh your metadata and rebuild your project

:::tip

The following steps are necessary each time you make changes to your **source** schema. This includes, adding,
modifying, or dropping tables.

:::

#### Step 12.1. Re-introspect your data source

```sh title="Run the introspection command again:"
ddn connector introspect my_trino
```

In `app/connector/my_trino/configuration.json`, you'll see schema updated to include operations for the `posts` table.
In `app/metadata/my_trino.hml`, you'll see `DOCS.PUBLIC.POSTS` present in the metadata as well.

#### Step 12.2. Update your metadata

```sh title="Add the posts model:"
ddn model add my_trino posts
```

#### Step 12.3. Create a new build

```sh title="Next, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

#### Step 12.4. Restart your services

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 13. Query your new build

```graphql title="Head back to your console and query the posts model:"
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}
```

```json title="You'll get a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is Alice's first post."
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts."
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 14. Create a relationship

```yaml title="Find the Posts.hml file in your connector's metadata directory and add the following relationship object to the bottom:"
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: user
  sourceType: Posts
  target:
    model:
      name: Users
      relationshipType: Object
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: userId
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: id
```

This will create a relationship that maps the `userId` for any post to the `id` of a user, allowing for nested queries.

### Step 15. Rebuild your project

```sh title="As your metadata has changed, create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Bring down the services by pressing CTRL+C and start them back up:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 16. Query using your relationship

```graphql title="Now, execute a nested query using your relationship:"
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    id
    title
    content
    user {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Which should return a result like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "My First Post",
        "content": "This is Alice's first post.",
        "user": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 25
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Another Post",
        "content": "Alice writes again!",
        "user": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 25
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post",
        "content": "Bob shares his thoughts.",
        "user": {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Bob",
          "age": 30
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "Hello World",
        "content": "Charlie joins the conversation.",
        "user": {
          "id": 3,
          "name": "Charlie",
          "age": 35
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura DDN project with Trino! 🎉

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to a local Trino instance.
- You set up metadata to represent your tables, which acts as the blueprint for your API.
- Then, you created a build — essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use API — and successfully ran your first
  GraphQL queries to fetch data.
- Along the way, you learned how to iterate on your schema and refresh your metadata to reflect changes.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

Take a look at our Trino docs to learn more about how to use Hasura DDN with Trino. Or, if you're ready, get started
with adding [permissions](/reference/metadata-reference/permissions.mdx) to control access to your API.
