# Supergraph

## Introduction

A supergraph is essentially the API for your project. It provides a unified interface for interacting with your data and
serves as the backbone for building applications that rely on multiple data sources.

## Components

The supergraph is made up of several key components that work together to deliver a seamless API experience:

- **Subgraphs**: These represent different data domains and can include multiple data connectors to bring in data from
  various sources.
- **Engine Plugins**: These plugins allow you to modify and extend the behavior of the engine to suit specific needs.
- **Builds**: A supergraph consists of immutable builds. At any given time, one build is applied, and it can be easily
  rolled back to a previous state if necessary.

## How it all works

The supergraph is defined using Hasura Metadata Language, which the engine uses to generate and serve the API. This
metadata acts as the blueprint for everything, including:

- Defining roles and permissions to control access.
- Configuring authentication mechanisms.
- Defining relationships across and between data sources.
- Specifying the GraphQL fields and types exposed by the API.

By centralizing these configurations, the supergraph ensures consistency and simplifies collaboration across teams.
