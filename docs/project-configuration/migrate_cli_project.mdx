# Migrating to new CLI

## What has happened?

A new revision of the DDN CLI has been released. With this release the local project directory
structure created by versions `<= v2024.05.23` is now deprecated.

This page contains some information on what has changed and instructions to migrate your existing local projects.


## What has changed?

- Local dev workflows using Docker have been introduced.
- The DDN CLI commands. See details on the new commands [here](/cli/commands/ddn).
- The local project directory structure. See details on the new structure [here](/project-configuration/config).
- SupergraphManifest and ConnectorManifest objects are now called Supergraph and Connector respectively

We **strongly recommend** you to go through our [new getting started guide](/getting-started/overview) to learn
about all the changes and experience the new workflow to develop your API with DDN.

:::note No changes made to DDN projects

Note that this a CLI only change and does not impact Hasura DDN projects. You can continue using existing DDN projects
and builds and also be able to create new builds using the new CLI revision (with the new local project structure).

## How to migrate an existing local project?

### Step 1: Get the new CLI

Follow the instructions [here](/cli/installation) to get the new DDN CLI.

### Step 2: Create a fresh project directory

```
ddn supergraph init --dir <new_proj_dir>
```

Set the default supergraph config file to the CLI context to avoid having to repeat it in future commands.
```
cd <new_proj_dir> && ddn context set supergraph ./supergraph.yaml
```

### Step 3: Add your subgraphs

For each subgraph in your project, run:

```
ddn subgraph init <subgraph-name>
```

### Step 4: Add your data connectors

- For self-deployed data connectors in your subgraphs, ie. `ConnectorManifest` of type `endpoints`, you can skip this step.

- For each data connector deployed on Hasura DDN in your subgraphs, ie. `ConnectorManifest` of type `cloud`, run:

  ```
  ddn connector init <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph-name> --hub-connector <connector-type>
  ```

  Ensure you use the same connector name and type from your existing `ConnectorManifest`.

- Post that follow the following steps based on your connector type

#### For hasura/postgres connectors

##### Set database connection string

Add a new key `CONNECTION_URI=<your_pg_url>` to the file `<subgraph_name>/connector/<connector_name>/.env.local`

```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://local.hasura.dev:4317
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=app_mypg
CONNECTION_URI=<your_pg_url>
```

##### Introspect the database schema

Run:

```
ddn connector introspect --connector <subgraph_name>/connector/<connector_name>/connector.yaml
```

#### For hasura/nodejs connectors

##### Copy over functions

Copy your `functions.ts` file to `<subgraph_name>/connector/<connector_name>/functions.ts`

### Step 5: Copy over connector metadata

For each data connector, copy the following from your existing project directory to the new project directory.

- the DataConnectorLink object. Typically `<connector_name>.hml`
- the Models and Commands. Typically `<connector_name>.hml`

In the DataConnectorLink object replace the `url` section with:

```

```

### Step x: Update VSCode extension

Update your Hasura VS Code extension to `v0.6.0` if not done automatically.

### Test your migration
