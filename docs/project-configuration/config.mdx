# Configuration

## Introduction

Hasura v3 introduces a new configuration for local projects.

## Sample project directory structure

The following is a sample directory structure of a local project:

```bash
.
├── .devcontainer
│  └── devcontainer.json
├── .hasura
│  └── context.yaml
├── .vscode
│  ├── extensions.json
│  ├── launch.json
│  └── tasks.json
├── engine
│  ├── .env.engine
│  ├── auth_config.json
│  ├── metadata.json
│  └── open_dd.json
├── globals
│  ├── .env.globals.cloud
│  ├── .env.globals.local
│  ├── auth-config.cloud.hml
│  ├── auth-config.local.hml
│  ├── compatibility-config.hml
│  ├── graphql-config.hml
│  ├── subgraph.cloud.yaml
│  └── subgraph.local.yaml
├── .gitattributes
├── compose.yaml
├── hasura.yaml
├── otel-collector-config.yaml
├── supergraph.cloud.yaml
└── supergraph.local.yaml
```

## Types of files

The new configuration relies on the following types of files:

| File type                                   | Description                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`hasura.yaml`](#hasurayaml)                | The file that denotes the root of a Hasura project.                                                                      |
| [`.env.*`](#envfiles)                       | Files that store environment variables.                                                                                  |
| [`supergraph.*.yaml`](#supergraph-config)   | Files that describe how to build the supergraph.                                                                         |
| [`connector.*.yaml`](#connector-config)     | Files that describe how to build a data connector.                                                                       |
| `*.hml`                                     | Hasura metadata files for a project.                                                                                     |
| [`globals`](#globals)                       | A directory, containing all the necessary configuration and metadata files, for the supergraph-level scope of a project. |
| [`.hasura/context.yaml`](#context-file)               | File that stores certain default values of a project.                                                                    |
| `compose.yaml`                              | Docker Compose files for local development.                                                                              |
| [`engine`](#engine)                         | Files mounted to the engine container for local development.                                                             |
| `otel-collector-config.yaml`                | Configuration for OpenTelemetry Collector used for seeing traces during local development.                               |

### hasura.yaml {#hasurayaml}

`hasura.yaml` appears at the root of a Hasura project.

```yaml
version: v2
```

The `version` section is used to specify the version of the project directory structure.

### .env.\* {#envfiles}

This file is used to store environment variables. The file should be in the format:

```.env
ENV1=val1
ENV2=val2
```

These files are referenced inside:

- Docker Compose files: Docker Compose files use \*.env files to specify environment variables needed for containers.
- Subgraph files: Subgraph files use \*.env files to specify environment variables. This is needed by `globals`
  and other Subgraphs. Each subgraph can have its own .env file.
- Connector files (such as `connector.yaml`): Connector files use \*.env files to specify environment variables needed
  for building the connector.

### supergraph.*.yaml {#supergraph-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to construct your supergraph. It will contain information such as which
subgraphs to include and which resources to use for the build.

For example:

```yaml
kind: Supergraph
version: v2
definition:
  subgraphs:
    - globals/subgraph.cloud.yaml
    - app/subgraph.yaml
```

By default, the CLI generates two files - `supergraph.cloud.yaml` and `supergraph.local.yaml` but any number of
supergraph files can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

`subgraphs` specifies path to all the subgraph config files. These are then read recursively to construct the metadata
for the supergraph.

### connector.*.yaml {#connector-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to build your connector. It will contain information such as the type of
connector and the location to the context files needed to build the connector.

For example:

```yaml
kind: Connector
version: v1
definition:
  name: mypg
  source: hasura/postgres:v0.7.0
  context: .
  envFile: .env.local
```

`version` is the version of the connector, `name` is a name given to the connector, `source` is the connector to use
specific to the data source, `context` specifies the connector directory and `envFile` specifies the connector specific
environment variables to use for introspecting and building the connector. If you are deploying your connector on DDN
cloud, you also need to specify `subgraph`. Value of this field is name of the subgraph you want to deploy your connector
to.

### .hasura/context.yaml {#context-file}

This specifies the default DDN project and supergraph file path. The default values are used by all commands that accept
`--supergraph` flag, `--subgraph` flag and `--project` flag. The flags can be used to override the default values.

```yaml
context:
  project: emerging-stag-9129
  supergraph: ../supergraph.yaml
  subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
```

This file is configured by the `ddn context set` command.

### Engine {#engine}

The `engine` directory contains the files required for Hasura v3 engine container. This directory has the following
structure:

```bash
├── .env.engine
├── auth_config.json
├── metadata.json
└── open_dd.json
```

The `.env.engine` file specifies environment variables required by the Hasura v3 engine container.

The `auth_config.json`, `metadata.json` and `open_dd.json` are generated as a result of `ddn supergraph build local`
command and does not need to be edited by the user.

### Globals {#globals}

The `globals` directory contains the supergraph configuration files. The included files are:

```bash
├── .env.globals.cloud
├── .env.globals.local
├── auth-config.cloud.hml
├── auth-config.local.hml
├── compatibility-config.hml
├── graphql-config.hml
├── subgraph.cloud.yaml
└── subgraph.local.yaml
```

:::info Organizing files

The contents of these files include the necessary metadata objects to build your supergraph. We've separated them out
into files organized by their purpose, but you can organize them anyway you like so long as the metadata objects within
them are all included.

:::

Each of these files' contents are used to configure the supergraph.

The `.env.globals.cloud` and `.env.globals.local` file contains all the environment variables of cloud and local
deployment respectively which is required by the globals subgraph objects.

The `auth-config.cloud.hml` and `auth-config.local.hml` file contains the authentication configuration for the globals
subgraph of cloud and local deployment respectively, allowing you to utilize either JWTs or webhooks.

The `compatibility-config.hml` file contains the compatibility configuration — using a version number — for the
supergraph.

The `graphql-config.hml` file contains the GraphQL configuration for the supergraph, which allows you to customize the
available query and mutation capabilities along with the schema.
