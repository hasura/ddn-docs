# Configuration

## Introduction

Hasura v3 introduces a new configuration for local projects.

## Sample project directory structure

The following is a sample directory structure of a local project:

```bash
.
├── .devcontainer
│  └── devcontainer.json
├── .hasura
│  └── context.yaml
├── .vscode
│  ├── extensions.json
│  ├── launch.json
│  └── tasks.json
├── engine
│  ├── .env.engine
│  ├── auth_config.json
│  ├── metadata.json
│  └── open_dd.json
├── globals
│  ├── .env.globals.cloud
│  ├── .env.globals.local
│  ├── subgraph.cloud.yaml
│  ├── subgraph.local.yaml
│  ├── auth-config.cloud.hml
│  ├── auth-config.local.hml
│  ├── compatibility-config.hml
│  └── graphql-config.hml
├── app
│  ├── .env.app.cloud
│  ├── .env.app.local
│  └── subgraph.yaml
├── .gitattributes
├── compose.yaml
├── hasura.yaml
├── otel-collector-config.yaml
├── supergraph.cloud.yaml
└── supergraph.local.yaml
```

## Types of files

The new configuration relies on the following types of files:

| File type                                 | Description                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`hasura.yaml`](#hasurayaml)              | The file that denotes the root of a Hasura project.                                        |
| [`.env.*`](#envfiles)                     | Files that store environment variables.                                                    |
| [`supergraph.*.yaml`](#supergraph-config) | Files that describe how to build the supergraph.                                           |
| [`subgraph.*.yaml`](#subgraph-config)     | Files that describe how to build a subgraph.                                               |
| [`connector.*.yaml`](#connector-config)   | Files that describe how to build a data connector.                                         |
| `*.hml`                                   | Hasura metadata files for a project.                                                       |
| [`.hasura/context.yaml`](#context-file)   | File that stores certain default values of a project.                                      |
| `compose.yaml`                            | Docker Compose files for local development.                                                |
| [`engine`](#engine)                       | Files mounted to the engine container for local development.                               |
| [`globals`](#globals)                     | Directory containing files for the **globals** subgraph.                                   |
| `otel-collector-config.yaml`              | Configuration for OpenTelemetry Collector used for seeing traces during local development. |

### hasura.yaml {#hasurayaml}

`hasura.yaml` appears at the root of a Hasura project.

For example:

```yaml
version: v2
```

- `version` specifies the version of the project directory structure.

### .env.\* {#envfiles}

This file is used to store environment variables. The file should be in the format:

```.env
ENV1=val1
ENV2=val2
```

These files are referenced inside:

- Docker Compose files: Docker Compose files use \*.env files to specify environment variables needed for containers.
- Subgraph files: Subgraph files use \*.env files to specify environment variables. This is needed by `globals` and
  other subgraphs. Each subgraph can have its own .env file.
- Connector files (such as `connector.yaml`): Connector files use \*.env files to specify environment variables needed
  for building the connector.

### supergraph.\*.yaml {#supergraph-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to construct your supergraph. It will contain information such as which subgraph
config files to use for building the supergraph

For example:

```yaml
kind: Supergraph
version: v2
definition:
  subgraphs:
    - globals/subgraph.cloud.yaml
    - app/subgraph.yaml
```

- `version` is the version of the supergraph object
- `subgraphs` specifies paths to all the subgraph config files. These are then read recursively to construct the
  metadata for the supergraph.

By default, the CLI generates two files - `supergraph.cloud.yaml` and `supergraph.local.yaml` but any number of
supergraph config files can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

### subgraph.\*.yaml {#subgraph-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to construct your subgraph. It will contain information such as which metadata
resources to use for the build.

For example:

```yaml
kind: Subgraph
version: v1
definition:
  name: app
  generator:
    rootPath: .
  includePaths:
    - metadata
```

- `version` is the version of the subgraph object
- `includePaths` specifies the directories and files where metadata for the subgraph can be found. If a directory is
  specified, all the \*.hml files inside the directory and its subdirectories will be used to construct the metadata.
- `generator.rootPath` specifies the directory into which any new files will be generated.

By default, the CLI generates a file called `subgraph.yaml` for a new subgraph but any number of subgraph config files
can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

### connector.\*.yaml {#connector-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to build your connector. It will contain information such as the type of
connector and the location to the context files needed to build the connector.

For example:

```yaml
kind: Connector
version: v1
definition:
  name: mypg
  source: hasura/postgres:v0.7.0
  context: .
  envFile: .env.local
```

- `version` is the version of the connector object
- `name` is a name given to the connector
- `source` is the connector to use specific to the data source
- `context` specifies the connector directory
- `envFile` specifies the connector specific environment variables to use for introspecting and building the connector.
  If you are deploying your connector on DDN cloud, you also need to specify `subgraph`. Value of this field is name of
  the subgraph you want to deploy your connector to.

By default, the CLI generates two files - `connector.cloud.yaml` and `connector.local.yaml` but any number of connector
config files can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

### .hasura/context.yaml {#context-file}

This specifies the default DDN project and supergraph file path. The default values are used by all commands that accept
`--supergraph` flag, `--subgraph` flag and `--project` flag. The flags can be used to override the default values.

```yaml
context:
  project: emerging-stag-9129
  supergraph: ../supergraph.cloud.yaml
  subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
```

This file is configured by the `ddn context set` command.

### Engine {#engine}

The `engine` directory contains the files required for Hasura v3 engine container. This directory has the following
structure:

```bash
├── .env.engine
├── auth_config.json
├── metadata.json
└── open_dd.json
```

The `.env.engine` file specifies environment variables required by the Hasura v3 engine container.

The `auth_config.json`, `metadata.json` and `open_dd.json` are generated as a result of `ddn supergraph build local`
command and do not need to be edited by the user.

### Globals {#globals}

The `globals` directory contains the files for the **globals** subgraph which is generated by default to hold the
supergraph-level metadata objects, i.e. `AuthConfig`, `GraphqlConfig` and `CompatibilityConfig`.

For example:

```bash
├── .env.globals.cloud
├── .env.globals.local
├── auth-config.cloud.hml
├── auth-config.local.hml
├── compatibility-config.hml
├── graphql-config.hml
├── subgraph.cloud.yaml
└── subgraph.local.yaml
```

- `auth-config.cloud.hml` and `auth-config.local.hml` files contain the `AuthConfig` object which define the
  authentication configuration for the supergraph for cloud and local deployments respectively.
- `compatibility-config.hml` file contains the compatibility date configuration for the supergraph.
- `graphql-config.hml` file contains the GraphQL configuration for the supergraph, which allows you to customize the
  available query and mutation capabilities along with the schema.
- `.env.globals.cloud` and `.env.globals.local` files contain all the environment variables, if any, which are required
  by the **globals** subgraph's metadata objects for cloud and local deployments respectively.
