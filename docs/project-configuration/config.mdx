# Project directory structure

## Introduction

Hasura DDN projects are configured via metadata and config files which are managed in a project directory.

## Sample project directory structure

The following is a sample directory structure of a local project:

```bash
.
├── hasura.yaml
├── supergraph.yaml
├── compose.yaml
├── .env
├── .env.cloud
├── otel-collector-config.yaml
├── engine
│   ├── .env.engine
│   └── build
│       ├── auth_config.json
│       ├── metadata.json
│       └── open_dd.json
├── .hasura
│   └── context.yaml
├── app
│   ├── metadata
│   └── subgraph.yaml
├── globals
│   ├── subgraph.yaml
│   └── metadata
│     ├── auth-config.hml
│     ├── compatibility-config.hml
│     └── graphql-config.hml
├── .devcontainer
│   └── devcontainer.json
├── .gitattributes
├── .gitignore
└── .vscode
    ├── extensions.json
    ├── launch.json
    └── tasks.json
```

## Types of files and directories

The configuration relies on the following types of files:

| File type                                    | Description                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`hasura.yaml`](#hasurayaml)                 | The file that denotes the root of a Hasura project.         |
| [`.env.*`](#envfiles)                        | Files that store environment variables.                     |
| [`supergraph.*.yaml`](#supergraph-config)    | Config files that describe how to build the supergraph.     |
| [`subgraph.*.yaml`](#subgraph-config)        | Config files that describe how to build a subgraph.         |
| [`connector.*.yaml`](#connector-config)      | Config files that describe how to build a data connector.   |
| [`*.hml`](#hml-files)                        | Files containing Hasura metadata objects of the supergraph. |
| [`context.yaml`](#context-file)              | Config file that stores project context configuration.      |
| [`compose.yaml`](#compose-files)             | Docker Compose files for local development.                 |
| [`otel-collector-config.yaml`](#otel-config) | File containing config for the OpenTelemetry Collector.     |

The configuration contains the following directories by default:

| Directory             | Description                                                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`engine`](#engine)   | Directory containing files required for running the engine container. |
| [`globals`](#globals) | Directory containing files for the **globals** subgraph.              |
| [`app`](#app)         | Directory containing files for the **app** subgraph.                  |


### hasura.yaml {#hasurayaml}

`hasura.yaml` appears at the root of a Hasura project.

For example:

```yaml title="hasura.yaml"
version: v3
```

- `version` specifies the version of the project directory structure.

### Env files {#envfiles}

These files are used to store environment variables. They are typically of the format `.env.*`.

The file structure should be in the format:

```.env title=".env"
ENV1=val1
ENV2=val2
```

When a new project directory is initialized with the DDN CLI, it creates a single `.env` file by default. This
file will store all the environment variables required for local development.

`ddn project init` command will initialize a single `.env.cloud` file which will be used to store all environment
variables required by the DDN project.

All .env files in the project root directory are ignored by default by the `.gitignore` file generated by the CLI.

It is also possible to split the single .env file into different .env files required for:

- Docker Compose: Docker Compose files can use .env files to specify environment variables needed for containers.
- Subgraph config files (such as `subgraph.yaml`): Each subgraph config can have its own .env file which will be used
  to specify environment variables required for building the subgraph.
- Connector config files (such as `connector.yaml`): Each connector config can have its own .env file which will be used
  to specify environment variables needed for building the connector.

Other than this, .env files can also be passed into various DDN commands using `--env-file` flag.

### Supergraph config files {#supergraph-config}

These files contain [Supergraph configs](/supergraph-modeling/build-configs.mdx#supergraph) which tell Hasura DDN how to
construct your supergraph. They are typically of the format `supergraph.*.yaml`.

It will contain information such as which subgraph config files to use for building the supergraph

For example:

```yaml title="supergraph.yaml"
kind: Supergraph
version: v2
definition:
  subgraphs:
    - globals/subgraph.yaml
    - app/subgraph.yaml
```

- `version` is the version of the supergraph object
- `subgraphs` specifies paths to all the subgraph config files. These are then read recursively to construct the
  metadata for the supergraph.

By default, the CLI generates a single supergraph file - `supergraph.yaml` but any number of supergraph config files can
be created and referenced in CLI commands.

### Subgraph config files {#subgraph-config}

These files contain [Subgraph configs](/supergraph-modeling/build-configs.mdx#subgraph) which tell Hasura DDN how to
construct your subgraph. They are typically of the format `subgraph.*.yaml`.

It will contain information such as which metadata resources to use for the build. It also defines how metadata is
generated for the subgraph by the CLI.

For example:

```yaml title="app/subgraph.yaml"
kind: Subgraph
version: v2
definition:
  name: app
  generator:
    rootPath: .
  includePaths:
    - metadata
  envMapping:
    POSTGRES_READ_URL:
      fromEnv: APP_POSTGRES_READ_URL
    POSTGRES_WRITE_URL:
      fromEnv: APP_POSTGRES_READ_URL
  connectors:
    - path: connector/mypg/connector.yaml
      connectorLinkName: mypg
```

- `version` is the version of the subgraph object
- `includePaths` specifies the directories and files where metadata for the subgraph can be found. If a directory is
  specified, all the \*.hml files inside the directory and its subdirectories will be used to construct the metadata.
- `generator.rootPath` specifies the directory into which any new files will be generated.
- `envMapping` declares the environment variables needed by the subgraph and where to read it from. For example,
  ```
  POSTGRES_WRITE_URL:
     fromEnv: APP_POSTGRES_WRITE_URL
  ```
  This means that some metadata in the subgraph requires an env var called `POSTGRES_WRITE_URL`. The value of this has
  to be read from an env var called `APP_POSTGRES_WRITE_URL` from any of the .env.\* files passed as input. Only env
  vars declared in the `envMapping` are passed into the subgraph metadata.
- `connectors` lists all the connectors that are to be built when this subgraph is built. It contains `path` to the
  connector configuration and the name of the corresponding connector link.

By default, the CLI generates a single file called `subgraph.yaml` for a new subgraph but any number of subgraph config
files can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

###  Connector config files {#connector-config}

These files contain [Connector configs](/supergraph-modeling/build-configs.mdx#connector) which tell Hasura DDN how to
build your connector. They are typically of the format ` connector.*.yaml`.

It will contain information such as the type of connector and the location to the context files needed to build the
connector.

For example:

```yaml title="app/connector/mypg/connector.yaml"
kind: Connector
version: v2
definition:
  name: mypg
  source: hasura/postgres:v1.0.1
  context: .
  envMapping:
    CONNECTION_URI:
      fromEnv: APP_MYPG_CONNECTION_URI
```

- `version` is the version of the connector object
- `name` is a name given to the connector
- `source` is the connector to use specific to the data source
- `context` specifies the connector directory
- `envMapping` declares the environment variables needed by the connector and where to read it from. It works the same
  way as it does for subgraphs. Only env vars declared in the `envMapping` are passed into the connector.

By default, the CLI generates a single `connector.yaml` file for every new connector that is added but any number of
connector config files can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

### HML files {#hml-files}

Files of the format `*.hml` contain the [metadata objects](/supergraph-modeling/overview.mdx) used to build the
supergraph.

### Context config file {#context-file}

This file, located at `.hasura/context.yaml`, specifies the different contexts and custom scripts set up for the
project.

Contexts allow setting default values for certain flags that are often needed in CLI commands. By default, a context
called `default` is created and set as the current context. Values in the context can be configured using the
`ddn context` set of CLI commands.

Scripts allow executing complex command sequences with simple memorable script names  using the `ddn run` CLI command.
By default, a script called `docker-start` is added to the context config to allow starting the Hasura v3 engine via
Docker Compose and the engine compose file.

For example:

```yaml title=".hasura/context.yaml"
kind: Context
version: v3
definition:
  current: default
  contexts:
    default:
      project: emerging-stag-9129
      supergraph: ../supergraph.yaml
      subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
      localEnvFile: ../.env
      cloudEnvFile: ../.env.cloud
  scripts:
    docker-start:
      bash: HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat) docker compose --env-file .env up --build --pull always -d
      powershell: $Env:HASURA_DDN_PAT = ddn auth print-pat; docker compose --env-file .env up --build --pull always -d
```

- `contexts` section contains the contexts and their key-values.
- `scripts` section contains the defined custom scripts.


### Docker Compose files {#compose-files}

Docker Compose files are generated to run your engine and connectors locally for development. They are typically of the
format `compose.yaml`.

When a new project directory is initialized with the DDN CLI, it creates a `compose.yaml` file by default to run the
Hasura engine locally. This Compose file contains an `engine` service to run the engine along with an
`otel-collector` service used to collect traces from the engine.

Every time a connector is initialized in a project, a `compose.yaml` files is generated for it to run the
connector locally. By default, this `compose-yaml` is also added to the engine Compose file via the `include` directive
to allow running the engine and connector together by just using the engine Compose file.

### OTEL config file {#otel-config}

This config file, typically `otel-collector-config.yaml`, contains the configuration for OpenTelemetry Collector used
for seeing traces during local development.

It is used by the `otel-collector` service defined in the engine Compose file.

### Engine directory {#engine}

The `engine` directory contains the files mounted to the Hasura v3 engine container during local development. This
directory has the following structure:

```bash
.
├── .env.engine
└── build
    ├── auth_config.json
    ├── metadata.json
    └── open_dd.json
```

The `.env.engine` file specifies environment variables required by the Hasura v3 engine container.

The `auth_config.json`, `metadata.json` and `open_dd.json` are generated as a result of `ddn supergraph build local`
command and do not need to be edited by the user.

All files inside `build` directory are ignored by default by the `.gitignore` file generated by the CLI.

### Globals subgraph directory {#globals}

The `globals` directory contains the files for the **globals** subgraph which is generated by default to hold the
supergraph-level metadata objects, i.e. `AuthConfig`, `GraphqlConfig` and `CompatibilityConfig`.

For example:

```bash
.
├── subgraph.yaml
└── metadata
    ├── auth-config.hml
    ├── compatibility-config.hml
    └── graphql-config.hml
```

- `auth-config.hml` contain the `AuthConfig` object which define the authentication configuration for the supergraph.
- `compatibility-config.hml` file contains the compatibility date configuration for the supergraph.
- `graphql-config.hml` file contains the GraphQL configuration for the supergraph, which allows you to customize the
  available query and mutation capabilities along with the schema.
- `subgraph.yaml` contains the config that describes how to build the globals subgraph.

### App subgraph directory {#app}

The `app` directory contains the metadata and connector related files for the **app** subgraph which is generated by
default. The name `app` is just based on convention and can be chosen to be anything.

For example:

```bash
.
├── metadata
├── connector
└── subgraph.yaml
```

- `metadata` directory contains the hml files containing metadata objects of the subgraph.
- `connector` directory contains the connector related files of the subgraph.
- `subgraph.yaml` contains the config that describes how to build and generate metadata for
  the subgraph.

A similar subgraph directory is created for every subgraph in the supergraph.
