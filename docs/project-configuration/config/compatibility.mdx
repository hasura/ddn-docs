# Compatibility Configuration

It is supergraph level configuration that allows specifying a date after which any backwards incompatible
changes made to Hasura DDN won't impact the metadata.

## Setting Compatibility Date

You can set the compatibility date in the `compatibility-config.hml` file located in the `globals` directory:
```yaml
kind: CompatibilityConfig
date: "2024-08-27"
```
Alternatively, you can specify the configuration using the [`CompatibilityConfig`](supergraph-modeling/compatibility-config.mdx)
metadata object.

A Hasura DDN project is initialized by a default compatibility date based on the release date of `ddn` CLI version.

## Compatibility Features
The compatibility configuration controls the following features within Hasura DDN:

### Bypass `relation_comparisons` NDC Capability

**Date:** `2024-09-03`

**Description:** Enables bypassing the `relation_comparisons` NDC capability for relationship predicates.
This allows you to use relationships in boolean expressions even if the data connector lacks compatibility.
When the capability is available, relationship predicates are resolved directly within the native data
connector for more efficient processing. If not, the predicates are handled at the API layer.

### Require GraphQL Config

**Date:** `2024-06-30`

**Description:** Enforce the need for [GraphQL Config](supergraph-modeling/graphql-config.mdx).
