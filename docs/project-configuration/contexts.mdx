# Contexts

## Introduction

The DDN CLI allows you set values in the project context to be used in place of commonly used flags to avoid having to
repeat them with every command.

The project context config is stored in the `.hasura/context.yaml` file in the project directory.

:::info Getting started

To work with contexts, follow the steps in the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) to set up a project with a supergraph.

:::

For example,

The following is how the command to create a supergraph build on Hasura DDN would typically look:
``` bash
ddn supergraph build create --supergraph supergraph.yaml --project pet-lion-2649 --env-file .env.cloud
```

With the appropriate values set in the context, the command can be shortened to:
``` bash
ddn supergraph build create
```

:::info CLI flag vs context hierarchy

A value passed via the CLI command flag takes precedence over the value set in context.

## Supported keys

The following are the keys supported to be set in the context along with the flags they correspond to:

| Context Key    | Definition                                                                   | CLI flag(s)                           |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `project`      | The DDN project to use for the operation                                     | `--project`                           |
| `supergraph`   | The supergraph config file to use for the operation                          | `--supergraph`, `--target-supergraph` |
| `subgraph`     | The subgraph config file to use for the operation                            | `--subgraph`, `--target-subgraph`     |
| `localEnvFile` | The env file to use for local operations. e.g. `ddn supergraph build local`  | `--env-file`, `--target-env-file`     |
| `cloudEnvFile` | The env file to use for cloud operations. e.g. `ddn supergraph build create` | `--env-file`, `--target-env-file`     |


## Initial state

On project directory creation, a context called `default` is initialized with the following values set by default:

```yaml
default:
  supergraph: <project-root>/supergraph.yaml
  subgraph: <project-root>/app/subgraph.yaml
  localEnvFile: <project-root>/.env
```

## Manage values in the context

### Set a value in the context

To set a value to the context, run:

```bash
ddn context set <key> <value>
```

### Get a value from the context

To get a value from the context, run:

```bash
ddn context get <key>
```

### Remove a value from the context

To remove a value from the context, run:

```bash
ddn context unset <key>
```


### Get all values set in the context

To get the name and contents of the current context, run:

```bash
ddn context get-current-context
```

## Multiple contexts

You can create multiple contexts with different values to easily switch between different deployment scenarios.

For example,

Say we have contexts `staging` and `production` with the following values:
```yaml
staging:
  project: stg-project
  cloudEnvFile: .env.stg
  ...
production:
  project: prod-project
  cloudEnvFile: .env.prd
  ...
```

Now we can create supergraph builds for the staging and production environments using:
```bash
# will use project name and env file from "staging" context
ddn supergraph build create --context staging
# will use project name and env file from "production" context
ddn supergraph build create --context production
```

### Create a new context

To create a new context, run:

```bash
ddn context create-context <context-name>
```

### Switch to another context

To switch the current context, run:

```bash
ddn context set-current-context <context-name>
```

### Override current context

You can also override the context used for a particular command using the `--context` flag.

For example:

```bash
ddn supergraph build create --context <context-name>
```
