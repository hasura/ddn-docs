# Builds

## Introduction

A build is a fully-functional, immutable [supergraph](/basics/core-concepts.mdx#supergraph) API which is built based on
your project's configuration.

Builds can be used to incrementally test your project's API.

While there can be many builds for a project, only one can be **applied** at a time. The applied build is the one that
is currently serving your API from a project's endpoint.

A build is not created in your local directory, but is rather created and stored in the Hasura DDN service. They are
lightweight and can be created as often as you like to check your changes.

## Create a new build

To create a build, you'll first need a [**project**](/project-configuration/projects.mdx). After which, you can create a build using the
following command:

```bash
ddn supergraph build create --supergraph ./supergraph.yaml --project <project-name>
```

The CLI will return information about your build:

```text
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Build Version | 606b3d797d                                                       |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Build URL     | https://stunning-eagle-6335-dev-606b3d797d.ddn.hasura.me/graphql |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Console Url   | https://console.hasura.com/project/stunning-eagle-6335/graphql   |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| FQDN          | stunning-eagle-6335-dev-606b3d797d.ddn.hasura.me                 |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Description   |                                                                  |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## List all builds

By default, the build will be created using the manifest you've identified as the default for your project in your
`hasura.yaml` file. You can override this by specifying a different manifest using the `--supergraph-manifest` flag:

```bash
ddn supergraph build get --project <project-name>
```

## Apply a build to its project

When you are happy with your build, you can apply it to a project using the following command:

```bash
ddn supergraph build apply <build-version> --project <project-name>
```

## Delete a build

Builds can be individually deleted using the following command:

```bash
ddn supergraph build delete <build-version> --project <project-name>
```

All builds for a project are deleted when a [project is deleted](/project-configuration/projects.mdx#delete).
