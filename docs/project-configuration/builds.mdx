# Supergraph Builds

## Introduction

A supergraph build is a fully-functional, immutable [supergraph](/basics/core-concepts.mdx#supergraph) API which is
built based on your project's configuration.

Supergraph builds can be used to incrementally test your project's API.

While there can be many supergraph builds for a project, only one can be **applied** at a time. The applied
supergraph build is the one that is currently serving your API from the project's endpoint.

A supergraph build is not created in your local directory, but is rather created and stored in the Hasura DDN service.
They are lightweight and can be created as often as you like to check your changes.

## Create a new supergraph build

To create a supergraph build, you'll first need a [Hasura DDN project](/project-configuration/projects.mdx). After
which, you can create a supergraph build using the following command:

```bash
ddn supergraph build create --supergraph ./supergraph.yaml --project <project-name>
```

The CLI will return information about your supergraph build:

```text
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Build Version | 606b3d797d                                                       |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Build URL     | https://stunning-eagle-6335-dev-606b3d797d.ddn.hasura.me/graphql |

| Description   |                                                                  |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## List all supergraph builds

You can list all supergraph builds created in a project using the following command:

```bash
ddn supergraph build get --project <project-name>
```

## Apply a supergraph build to its project

When you are happy with your build, you can apply it to the project using the following command:

```bash
ddn supergraph build apply <build-version> --project <project-name>
```

## Delete a supergraph build

Supergraph builds can be individually deleted using the following command:

```bash
ddn supergraph build delete <build-version> --project <project-name>
```

All supergraph builds for a project are deleted when a [project is deleted](/project-configuration/projects.mdx#delete).
