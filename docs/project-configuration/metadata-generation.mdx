# Generating metadata

## Introduction

The DDN CLI can auto-generate metadata for your supergraph based on the schema of the sources added via
[data connectors](/connectors/overview.mdx). You can also manually edit the metadata using an editor.

The [Supergraph modeling](/supergraph-modeling/overview.mdx) section has details of the various metadata objects that
make up your supergraph.

## Generating metadata

### Using the CLI

Once you have [configured your supergraph](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx) and added a connector, you would typically
use the following commands on a day-to-day basis to generate and update the supergraph metadata based on the schema of
your data source:

- **Step 1:** Introspect the data source and update the connector schema:
  ```bash
  ddn connector introspect <connector-name>
  ```
  This will update the connector configuration based on the data source and update the connector schema in the
  corresponding [DataConnectorLink](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx).

- **Step 2:** Add models, commands and relationships from the connector schema:
  ```bash
  ddn model add <connector-name> "*"
  ddn command add <connector-name> "*"
  ddn relationship add <connector-name> "*"
  ```

  This will create and update metadata objects for the entities in your data source to expose them via the GraphQL API.

  The CLI generates metadata objects based on the [generator config](#subgraph-generator-config) defined in the
  subgraph config file.

-  You can then build the supergraph with the new metadata to run with the local engine:
   ```bash
   ddn supergraph build local
   ddn run docker-start
   ```

### Using an editor

You can also manually add or update the metadata objects using an editor. The [Hasura VS code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura)
assists with authoring metadata manually.

As mentioned in the previous section you would typically use the CLI to generate most of your metadata. That being said
you would typically need to manually edit metadata to define [permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx) and
[relationships](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx) or to customize the metadata auto-generated by the CLI, e.g. to
modify descriptions, graphql field names, etc.

## Subgraph generator config {#subgraph-generator-config}

The configuration for generating metadata for a subgraph is defined in the `generator` field of the subgraph config file
of the subgraph.

For example,

```yaml title="app/subgraph.yaml"
kind: Subgraph
version: v2
definition:
  name: app
  #highlight-start
  generator:
    rootPath: .
    graphqlRootFieldPrefix: app_
    graphqlTypeNamePrefix: App_
    namingConvention: graphql
  #highlight-end
  includePaths:
    - metadata
  envMapping:
    ...
```

The following are the supported configuration options:

### rootPath

Defines the directory in which new metadata files are generated. Metadata is generated in the `/metadata` directory in
the defined root path. It is defined relative to the subgraph config file.

**Default**: `.` i.e. metadata is generated in the `<subgraph-name>/metadata` directory

### graphqlRootFieldPrefix

Defines the prefix to add to all GraphQL root fields generated for models and commands in the subgraph.

**Default**: `""` i.e. no prefix is added by default

Also see: [Rename GraphQL prefixes command](/cli/commands/ddn_codemod_rename-graphql-prefixes)

### graphqlTypeNamePrefix

Defines the prefix to add to all GraphQL types generated for models and commands in the subgraph.

**Default**: `""` i.e. no prefix is added by default

Also see: [Rename GraphQL prefixes command](/cli/commands/ddn_codemod_rename-graphql-prefixes)

### namingConvention

Defines the naming convention used while generating GraphQL types and root fields generated for models and commands in
the subgraph.

**Default**: `graphql`

The following are the supported values:

| Convention | Description                                                                                                                        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `graphql`  | Convert the identifier from the data source to the GraphQL naming convention. i.e. PascalCase for types, camelCase for root fields |
| `none`     | Use the identifier from the data source as is.                                                                                     |
