# Metadata generation

## Introduction

The DDN CLI can auto-generate metadata for your supergraph based on the schema of the data sources added to the
supergraph.

## Generating metadata

The following commands can be used to generate and update metadata for your data source.

- Introspect the data source and update the connector schema:
  ```bash
  ddn connector introspect <connector-name>
  ```

- Add models, commands and relationships from the connector schema:
  ```bash
  ddn model add <connector-name> "*"
  ddn command add <connector-name> "*"
  ddn relationship add <connector-name> "*"
  ```

## Subgraph generator config

The configuration for generating metadata for a subgraph is defined in the `generator` field of the subgraph config file
of the subgraph.

For example,

```yaml title="app/subgraph.yaml"
kind: Subgraph
version: v2
definition:
  name: app
  #highlight-start
  generator:
    rootPath: .
    graphqlRootFieldPrefix: app_
    graphqlTypeNamePrefix: App_
    namingConvention: graphql
  #highlight-end
  includePaths:
    - metadata
  envMapping:
    ...
```

### rootPath

Defines the directory in which new metadata files are generated. Metadata is generated in the `/metadata` directory in
the defined root path. It is defined relative to the subgraph config file.

**Default value**: `.` \
i.e. metadata is generated in `<subgraph-name>/metadata` directory

### graphqlRootFieldPrefix

Defines the prefix to add to all GraphQL root fields generated for models and commands in the subgraph.

**Default value**: `""` \
i.e. no prefix added by default

### graphqlTypeNamePrefix

Defines the prefix to add to all GraphQL types generated for models and commands in the subgraph.

**Default value**: `""` \
i.e. no prefix added by default

### namingConvention

Defines the naming convention used while generating GraphQL types and root fields generated for models and commands in
the subgraph.

**Default value**: `graphql`

The following are the supported values:

| Convention | Description                                                                                                                        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `graphql`  | Convert the identifier from the data source to the GraphQL naming convention. i.e. PascalCase for types, camelCase for root fields |
| `none`     | Use the identifier from the data source as is.                                                                                     |
