# Upgrading to project config v3

## What has happened?

A new revision (**v2.x.x**) of the [DDN CLI](/cli/installation.mdx) has been released with some changes to the project
directory structure and CLI commands. With this release, local project directory structures created by CLI versions
**\< v2.0.0** are now deprecated.

## What has changed?

- The project config version defined in `hasura.yaml` is bumped from `v2` to `v3`.
- You can now create multiple contexts to easily switch between different deployment scenarios.
- The `Connector` object is upgraded from `v1` to `v2`.
  - The env variables expected by the connector now need to be explicitly defined in an `envMapping` property.
- The `Subgraph` object is upgraded from `v1` to `v2`.
  - The env variables required to build the subgraph now need to be explicitly defined in an `envMapping` property.
  - The connectors in the subgraph and their corresponding connector links can now be defined in the subgraph config to
    simplify connector update and supergraph build operations.
  - the `subgraph-env` flag has now been deprecated.
- The behaviour, arguments and flags of certain CLI commands have a few changes. Some major changes are listed below:
  - `supergraph init`
    - Takes directory as an argument. `--dir` flag is deprecated.
    - Also creates a subgraph `app` in the supergraph by default.
  - `connector init`
    - Introduces an interactive flag (`-i`) to simplify choosing the connector type and providing any required env
      variables.
    - Also creates the corresponding data connector link for the connector by default.
  - `connector introspect`
    - Also updates the schema of the corresponding data connector link for the connector by default.
  - `connector build create`
    - the `region-env` flag has now been deprecated.
  - `supergraph build local`
    - the `subgraph-env` flag has now been deprecated.
    - now outputs the build artifacts to the `/engine/build` directory without the need for the `--output-dir` flag.
  - `supergraph build create`
    - the `subgraph-env` flag has now been deprecated.

We recommend you go through our [new quickstart guide](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx) to check the simplified workflow
to develop your API with DDN.

:::info No changes to existing DDN projects

Note that this is a CLI-only change and does not impact Hasura DDN projects. You can continue using existing DDN
projects and builds and also be able to create new builds on them with both the new and old CLI revisions.

Though we strongly recommend updating to the latest version of the CLI and project structure by following the steps
below.

:::

## Migrate an existing local project

Below are steps to convert a local project created with the DDN CLI versions `< 2.0.0` to the new project
structure.

### Step 1: Get the new CLI

<InstallTheCli revision="v4" />

Also, update your Hasura VS Code extension to `v2.x.x` if not done automatically.

:::info Need the previous CLI revision?

Note that the above will overwrite your current DDN CLI revision. You can re-install the previous revision by replacing
`/ddn/cli/v4/` with `/ddn/cli/v3/` in the above download command.

:::

### Step 2: Run the codemod command

You can update your existing your local project by running the following in your project directory:

```bash
ddn codemod upgrade-project-config-v2-to-v3 --dir <project-dir-path>
```

This command will guide you through a series of transformations to update your project to the latest format.

The transformations are as follows:

1. Upgrade project context to v2

2. Upgrade Subgraph configs to v2

3. Upgrade Connector configs to v2

4. Secure Connector with a token

5. Add connector mappings in subgraph



### Step 3: Update engine build dir (optional)

As mentioned above, the `ddn supergraph build local` now outputs the build artifacts to the `/engine/build` directory
without the need for the `--output-dir` flag. To avoid having to provide the flag in the future, you can move your
build assets to this directory and update the engine compose file to use this directory instead.

#### Step 3.1: Move engine build assets

```bash title="in project root directory, run:"
mkdir engine/build
mv engine/*.json engine/build
```

#### Step 3.2: Update engine compose file

```yaml title="e.g. compose.yaml"
services:
  ...
  engine:
    ...
    build:
      context: engine
      dockerfile_inline: |-
        FROM ghcr.io/hasura/v3-engine
        #highlight-start
        # update to the following
        COPY ./build /md/
        #highlight-end
    develop:
      watch:If you have a shared supergraph config file,
        - action: sync+restart
          #highlight-start
          # update to the following
          path: engine/build
          #highlight-end
          target: /md/
    env_file:
      - engine/.env.engine
    ...
  ...
```



### Step 4: Create top level .env files (optional)

To simplify management of the environment variables used by the various connectors and subgraphs in your supergraph,
you could choose to combine all the individual env files into single top level env files, e.g. `.env.local` and
`.env.cloud`. You can then pass the same env files to your connector and subgraph config objects.

If you have a shared supergraph config file for local and cloud, both these env files can then be set into your context
to allow managing both local and cloud deployments using the same context. ie.

```bash title="In project root with single top level env files:"
ddn context set localEnvFile .env.local
ddn context set cloudEnvFile .env.cloud
````

You can then run supergraph build command for both local and DDN using the same context.

```bash
ddn supergraph build local  # will use localEnvFile from context, ie. .env.local
ddn supergraph build create  # will use cloudEnvFile from context, ie. .env.cloud
```

### hasura.yaml {#hasurayaml}

`hasura.yaml` appears at the root of a Hasura project.

For example:

```yaml
version: v2
```

- `version` specifies the version of the project directory structure.

### .env.\* {#envfiles}

This file is used to store environment variables. The file should be in the format:

```.env
ENV1=val1
ENV2=val2
```

These files are referenced inside:

- Docker Compose files: Docker Compose files use \*.env files to specify environment variables needed for containers.
- Subgraph files: Subgraph files use \*.env files to specify environment variables. This is needed by `globals` and
other subgraphs. Each subgraph can have its own .env file.
- Connector files (such as `connector.yaml`): Connector files use \*.env files to specify environment variables needed
for building the connector.

### supergraph.\*.yaml {#supergraph-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to construct your supergraph. It will contain information such as which subgraph
config files to use for building the supergraph

For example:

```yaml
kind: Supergraph
version: v2
definition:
  subgraphs:
    - globals/subgraph.cloud.yaml
    - app/subgraph.yaml
```

- `version` is the version of the supergraph object
- `subgraphs` specifies paths to all the subgraph config files. These are then read recursively to construct the
metadata for the supergraph.

By default, the CLI generates two files - `supergraph.cloud.yaml` and `supergraph.local.yaml` but any number of
supergraph config files can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

### subgraph.\*.yaml {#subgraph-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to construct your subgraph. It will contain information such as which metadata
resources to use for the build.

For example:

```yaml
kind: Subgraph
version: v1
definition:
  name: app
  generator:
    rootPath: .
  includePaths:
    - metadata
```

- `version` is the version of the subgraph object
- `includePaths` specifies the directories and files where metadata for the subgraph can be found. If a directory is
specified, all the \*.hml files inside the directory and its subdirectories will be used to construct the metadata.
- `generator.rootPath` specifies the directory into which any new files will be generated.

By default, the CLI generates a file called `subgraph.yaml` for a new subgraph but any number of subgraph config files
can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

### connector.\*.yaml {#connector-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to build your connector. It will contain information such as the type of
connector and the location to the context files needed to build the connector.

For example:

```yaml
kind: Connector
version: v1
definition:
  name: mypg
  source: hasura/postgres:v0.7.0
  context: .
  envFile: .env.local
```

- `version` is the version of the connector object
- `name` is a name given to the connector
- `source` is the connector to use specific to the data source
- `context` specifies the connector directory
- `envFile` specifies the connector specific environment variables to use for introspecting and building the connector.
If you are deploying your connector on DDN cloud, you also need to specify `subgraph`. Value of this field is name of
the subgraph you want to deploy your connector to.

By default, the CLI generates two files - `connector.cloud.yaml` and `connector.local.yaml` but any number of connector
config files can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

### .hasura/context.yaml {#context-file}

This specifies the default DDN project and supergraph file path. The default values are used by all commands that accept
`--supergraph` flag, `--subgraph` flag and `--project` flag. The flags can be used to override the default values.

```yaml
context:
  project: emerging-stag-9129
  supergraph: ../supergraph.cloud.yaml
  subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
```

This file is configured by the `ddn context set` command.

### Engine {#engine}

The `engine` directory contains the files required for Hasura v3 engine container. This directory has the following
structure:

```bash
├── .env.engine
├── auth_config.json
├── metadata.json
└── open_dd.json
```

The `.env.engine` file specifies environment variables required by the Hasura v3 engine container.

The `auth_config.json`, `metadata.json` and `open_dd.json` are generated as a result of `ddn supergraph build local`
command and do not need to be edited by the user.

### Globals {#globals}

The `globals` directory contains the files for the **globals** subgraph which is generated by default to hold the
supergraph-level metadata objects, i.e. `AuthConfig`, `GraphqlConfig` and `CompatibilityConfig`.

For example:

```bash
├── .env.globals.cloud
├── .env.globals.local
├── auth-config.cloud.hml
├── auth-config.local.hml
├── compatibility-config.hml
├── graphql-config.hml
├── subgraph.cloud.yaml
└── subgraph.local.yaml
```

- `auth-config.cloud.hml` and `auth-config.local.hml` files contain the `AuthConfig` object which define the
authentication configuration for the supergraph for cloud and local deployments respectively.
- `compatibility-config.hml` file contains the compatibility date configuration for the supergraph.
- `graphql-config.hml` file contains the GraphQL configuration for the supergraph, which allows you to customize the
available query and mutation capabilities along with the schema.
- `.env.globals.cloud` and `.env.globals.local` files contain all the environment variables, if any, which are required
by the **globals** subgraph's metadata objects for cloud and local deployments respectively.
