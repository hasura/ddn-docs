# Upgrading to project config v3

## What has happened?

A new revision (**v2.x.x**) of the [DDN CLI](/cli/installation.mdx) has been released with some changes to the project
directory structure and CLI commands. With this release, local project directory structures created by CLI versions **\<
v2.0.0** are now deprecated.

## What has changed?

- The project config version defined in `hasura.yaml` is bumped from `v2` to `v3`.
- The `Connector` object is upgraded from `v1` to `v2`.
- The `Subgraph` object is upgraded from `v1` to `v2`.

### Named contexts

Named contexts are introduced. You can now create multiple contexts to easily switch between different deployment
scenarios. e.g.

```bash
ddn supergraph build create --context staging  # will use cloudEnvFile from staging context, e.g. .env.stg
ddn supergraph build create --context prod  # will use cloudEnvFile from prod context, e.g. .env.prod
```

### Top-level env files

To simplify the management of environment variables across connectors and subgraphs in your supergraph, the CLI now
defaults to using a common top-level `.env` file instead of generating separate `.env` files for each subgraph and
connector.

You can set environment files for local development and cloud builds using the `localEnvFile` and `cloudEnvFile` keys in
the context. **If you're using a shared supergraph config file for both local and cloud environments**, you can specify
both environment files in your context to manage local and cloud deployments within the same context.

```bash title="In project root with single top-level env files:"
ddn context set localEnvFile .env
ddn context set cloudEnvFile .env.cloud
```

You can then run supergraph build command for both local and DDN using the same context.

```bash
ddn supergraph build local  # will use localEnvFile from context, i.e. .env
ddn supergraph build create  # will use cloudEnvFile from context, i.e. .env.cloud
```

### Default naming convention for GraphQL types/fields

The default naming convention for GraphQL types and fields has changed. The CLI no longer adds the subgraph name as a
prefix to the generated GraphQL types and fields by default.

You can configure these yourself by [customizing prefixes](#step-42-add-metadata-generator-prefix).

### Subgraph and Connector config env mapping

The environment variables expected by a connector or subgraph now need to be explicitly defined in an `envMapping`
property in their config files.

The `envMapping` field defines how any provided environment variables are mapped to the environment variables expected
by the connector / subgraph.

### Simplified workflows using connector mapping

The mapping between connectors in the subgraph and their corresponding connector links can now be defined in the
subgraph config to simplify connector update and supergraph build operations.

- You can now introspect a connector and update its corresponding connector link using a single command.
- You can now create a supergraph build on Hasura DDN along with its dependent connector builds using a single command.

:::info Check out the quickstart

We recommend you go through our [new quickstart guide](/quickstart.mdx) to check the simplified workflow to develop your
API.

:::

### Connector build secure tokens

Any connector build created on Hasura DDN will now be secured with a token. The token needs to be sent as a Bearer token
in all requests that go to the connector build.

### Command behavior

The behavior, arguments and flags of certain CLI commands have a few changes. Some major changes are listed below:

- `ddn supergraph init`
  - Takes directory as an argument. `--dir` flag is deprecated.
  - Also creates a subgraph `app` in the supergraph by default.
  - Generates a top-level `.env` file for local development.
  - Sets the `supergraph`, `subgraph` and `localEnvFile` keys in the context.
- `ddn connector init`
  - Introduces an interactive flag (`-i`) to simplify choosing the connector type and providing any required env
    variables.
  - Writes the required env variables to a `target-env` file.
  - Also creates the corresponding [data connector link](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx) for the
    connector by default.
- `ddn connector introspect`
  - Also updates the schema of the corresponding data connector link for the connector by default.
- `ddn connector build create`
  - the `region-env` flag has now been deprecated.
- `ddn supergraph build local`
  - the `subgraph-env` flag has now been deprecated.
  - now outputs the build artifacts to the `/engine/build` directory without the need for the `--output-dir` flag.
  - uses the `localEnvFile` from the context for the build by default.
- `ddn supergraph build create`
  - the `subgraph-env` flag has now been deprecated.
  - uses the `cloudEnvFile` from the context for the build by default.

:::info No changes to existing DDN projects

Note that this is a CLI-only change and does not impact Hasura DDN projects. You can continue using existing DDN
projects and builds and also be able to create new builds on them with both the new and old CLI revisions.

Though, we strongly recommend updating to the latest version of the CLI and project structure by following the steps
below.

:::

## Migrate an existing local project

Below are steps to convert a local project created with the DDN CLI versions `< 2.0.0` to the new project structure.

### Step 1: Get the new CLI

<InstallTheCli revision="v4" />

Also, update your Hasura VS Code extension to `v2.x.x` if not done automatically.

:::info Need the previous CLI revision?

Note that the above will overwrite your current DDN CLI revision. You can re-install the previous revision by replacing
`/ddn/cli/v4/` with `/ddn/cli/v3/` in the above download command.

:::

### Step 2: Run the codemod command

You can update your existing local project by running the following in your project directory:

```bash title="in project root directory, run:"
ddn codemod upgrade-project-config-v2-to-v3 --dir .
```

This command will guide you through a series of transformations to update your project to the latest format.

### Step 3: Verify the migration

Create a new local supergraph build using:

```bash
# set context with local supergraph config e.g. local
ddn context set-current-context local
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir engine
```

Run your local supergraph and verify the generated API is the same as what you had earlier.

Create a new supergraph build on Hasura DDN using:

```bash
# use context with cloud supergraph config e.g. cloud
ddn supergraph build create --context cloud
```

On build completion, the build version, API endpoint, and console URLs will be returned in the response.

You can now head to your project console using the console URL returned in the previous step and verify the API
generated with the above build is the same as what you had earlier.

### Step 4: Make optional changes

#### Step 4.1: Update engine build dir

As mentioned above, the `ddn supergraph build local` now outputs the build artifacts to the `/engine/build` directory
without the need for the `--output-dir` flag. To avoid having to provide the flag in the future, you can move your build
assets to this directory and update the engine compose file to use this directory instead.

##### Step 4.1.1: Move engine build assets

```bash title="in project root directory, run:"
mkdir engine/build
mv engine/*.json engine/build
```

##### Step 4.1.2: Update engine compose file

```yaml title="e.g. compose.yaml"
services:
  ...
  engine:
    ...
    build:
      context: engine
      dockerfile_inline: |-
        FROM ghcr.io/hasura/v3-engine
        #highlight-start
        # update to the following
        COPY ./build /md/
        #highlight-end
    develop:
      watch:
        - action: sync+restart
          #highlight-start
          # update to the following
          path: engine/build
          #highlight-end
          target: /md/
    env_file:
      - engine/.env.engine
    ...
  ...
```

As the engine build directory contains your local build assets, it can be ignored from you version control. You can
choose to do so by adding it to a `.gitignore` file.

#### Step 4.2: Add metadata generator prefix

As the CLI now doesn't add the subgraph name as a prefix to the generated GraphQL types and fields by default. You can
keep the earlier behavior by updating the generator config in your Subgraph configs.

```yaml title="For example, my_subgraph/subgraph.yaml"
kind: Subgraph
version: v2
definition:
  #highlight-start
  name: my_subgraph
  #highlight-end
  generator:
    rootPath: .
    #highlight-start
    graphqlRootFieldPrefix: my_subgraph_
    graphqlTypeNamePrefix: My_subgraph_
    #highlight-end
  envFile: .env.my_subgraph.local
  ...
```

## Things to remember

### Adding new connectors

While adding new connectors, remember to:

- Add the required env vars for the connector to all env files e.g. `.env.cloud`. By default, it will be added to only
  the env file set as localEnvFile in the current context, e.g. `.env` or the one provided via flag.
- Add the connectorMapping and envMapping for the new connector URLs and Authorization headers to all subgraph config
  files. By default, it will be added to only the subgraph config set in the current context or provided via flag.

##### hasura.yaml {#hasurayaml}

`hasura.yaml` appears at the root of a Hasura project.

For example:

```yaml
version: v2
```

- `version` specifies the version of the project directory structure.

##### .env.\* {#envfiles}

This file is used to store environment variables. The file should be in the format:

```.env
ENV1=val1
ENV2=val2
```

These files are referenced inside:

- Docker Compose files: Docker Compose files use \*.env files to specify environment variables needed for containers.
- Subgraph files: Subgraph files use \*.env files to specify environment variables. This is needed by `globals` and
  other subgraphs. Each subgraph can have its own .env file.
- Connector files (such as `connector.yaml`): Connector files use \*.env files to specify environment variables needed
  for building the connector.

##### supergraph.\*.yaml {#supergraph-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to construct your supergraph. It will contain information such as which subgraph
config files to use for building the supergraph

For example:

```yaml
kind: Supergraph
version: v2
definition:
  subgraphs:
    - globals/subgraph.cloud.yaml
    - app/subgraph.yaml
```

- `version` is the version of the supergraph object
- `subgraphs` specifies paths to all the subgraph config files. These are then read recursively to construct the
  metadata for the supergraph.

By default, the CLI generates two files - `supergraph.cloud.yaml` and `supergraph.local.yaml` but any number of
supergraph config files can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

##### subgraph.\*.yaml {#subgraph-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to construct your subgraph. It will contain information such as which metadata
resources to use for the build.

For example:

```yaml
kind: Subgraph
version: v1
definition:
  name: app
  generator:
    rootPath: .
  includePaths:
    - metadata
```

- `version` is the version of the subgraph object
- `includePaths` specifies the directories and files where metadata for the subgraph can be found. If a directory is
  specified, all the \*.hml files inside the directory and its subdirectories will be used to construct the metadata.
- `generator.rootPath` specifies the directory into which any new files will be generated.

By default, the CLI generates a file called `subgraph.yaml` for a new subgraph but any number of subgraph config files
can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

##### connector.\*.yaml {#connector-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to build your connector. It will contain information such as the type of
connector and the location to the context files needed to build the connector.

For example:

```yaml
kind: Connector
version: v1
definition:
  name: mypg
  source: hasura/postgres:v0.7.0
  context: .
  envFile: .env.local
```

- `version` is the version of the connector object
- `name` is a name given to the connector
- `source` is the connector to use specific to the data source
- `context` specifies the connector directory
- `envFile` specifies the connector specific environment variables to use for introspecting and building the connector.
  If you are deploying your connector on DDN cloud, you also need to specify `subgraph`. Value of this field is name of
  the subgraph you want to deploy your connector to.

By default, the CLI generates two files - `connector.cloud.yaml` and `connector.local.yaml` but any number of connector
config files can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

##### .hasura/context.yaml {#context-file}

This specifies the default DDN project and supergraph file path. The default values are used by all commands that accept
`--supergraph` flag, `--subgraph` flag and `--project` flag. The flags can be used to override the default values.

```yaml
context:
  project: emerging-stag-9129
  supergraph: ../supergraph.cloud.yaml
  subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
```

This file is configured by the `ddn context set` command.

##### Engine {#engine}

The `engine` directory contains the files required for Hasura v3 engine container. This directory has the following
structure:

```bash
├── .env.engine
├── auth_config.json
├── metadata.json
└── open_dd.json
```

The `.env.engine` file specifies environment variables required by the Hasura v3 engine container.

The `auth_config.json`, `metadata.json` and `open_dd.json` are generated as a result of `ddn supergraph build local`
command and do not need to be edited by the user.

##### Globals {#globals}

The `globals` directory contains the files for the **globals** subgraph which is generated by default to hold the
supergraph-level metadata objects, i.e. `AuthConfig`, `GraphqlConfig` and `CompatibilityConfig`.

For example:

```bash
├── .env.globals.cloud
├── .env.globals.local
├── auth-config.cloud.hml
├── auth-config.local.hml
├── compatibility-config.hml
├── graphql-config.hml
├── subgraph.cloud.yaml
└── subgraph.local.yaml
```

- `auth-config.cloud.hml` and `auth-config.local.hml` files contain the `AuthConfig` object which define the
  authentication configuration for the supergraph for cloud and local deployments respectively.
- `compatibility-config.hml` file contains the compatibility date configuration for the supergraph.
- `graphql-config.hml` file contains the GraphQL configuration for the supergraph, which allows you to customize the
  available query and mutation capabilities along with the schema.
- `.env.globals.cloud` and `.env.globals.local` files contain all the environment variables, if any, which are required
  by the **globals** subgraph's metadata objects for cloud and local deployments respectively.
