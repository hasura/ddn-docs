# Upgrading to context config v3

## What has happened?

A new revision (**v2.5.0**) of the [DDN CLI](/reference/cli/installation.mdx) has been released with enhancements to the
context config. This update introduces a powerful new scripting feature, allowing users to define and execute custom
scripts directly from their context configuration.

## What has changed?

- The project's context config is bumped from `v2` to `v3`
- A new scripts field has been introduced in the context configuration.
- The CLI now supports running custom scripts with environment detection.

### Scripting Feature

The new scripting feature allows you to define custom scripts in your context configuration. These scripts can be
executed with `ddn run` command, and the CLI will automatically detect your environment to run the appropriate version
of the script. Here's an example of the new context configuration structure:

```yaml
kind: Context
version: v3
definition:
  current: default
  contexts:
    default:
      supergraph: ../supergraph.yaml
      subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
      localEnvFile: ../.env
  scripts:
    docker-start:
      bash: HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat) docker compose --env-file .env up --build --pull always -d
      powershell: $Env:HASURA_DDN_PAT = (ddn auth print-pat); docker compose --env-file .env up --build --pull always -d
```

#### Running Scripts

To run a script, use the command:

```bash
ddn run docker-start
```

#### Multi-Platform Support

You can define scripts for bash and PowerShell under a single script name. DDN CLI will automatically select the correct
script version based on your environment.

#### Custom Scripts

You're free to create your own scripts tailored to your workflow needs. This allows you to encapsulate complex command
sequences into simple, memorable script names.

:::info Paths in scripts are relative to your project's root path. :::

### Backwards Compatibility

Please note that context configuration v2 is still fully supported. While we encourage you to upgrade to v3 to take
advantage of the new scripting features, you can continue to use v2 configurations without any issues.

## Migrate an existing project

To start using this new feature in an existing project:

1. Update your CLI to the latest version.

```bash
ddn update-cli
```

2. Run codemod from Hasura project directory to update your project context configuration to v3.

```bash
ddn codemod upgrade-context-v2-to-v3 --dir .
```

3. By default, we add a `docker-start` script for you so that you can just run `ddn run docker-start` to get the local
   local supergraph and connectors running using Docker

## Creating and running a custom script

Add this under your context configuration's script field:

```yaml
my-custom-script:
  bash: echo "Hello from bash!"
  powershell: Write-Host "Hello from PowerShell!"
```

Then run it using:

```bash
ddn run my-custom-script
```
