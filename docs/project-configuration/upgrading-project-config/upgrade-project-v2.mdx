# Upgrading to project config v2

## What has happened?

A new revision (**2024.06.06**) of the [DDN CLI](/cli/installation.mdx) has been released. With this release, local
project directory structures created by CLI versions **\<= 2024.06.05** are now out-of-date and deprecated.

This page contains some information on what has changed and instructions to migrate your existing local projects.
However, for users to most efficiently familiarize themselves with the new CLI and project structure, we recommend
setting up a new project from scratch by following the new [getting started guide](/getting-started/overview.mdx).

:::warning A newer CLI version has been released since!

A newer revision (**v1.x.x**) of the [DDN CLI](/cli/installation.mdx) has been released. See the upgrade guide
[here](project-configuration/upgrading-project-config/upgrade-supergraph-v2.mdx).

If your local project was created by CLI versions **\<= 2024.06.05**, you will need to update your local project
directory using this current guide first before upgrading to the above revision.

:::

## What has changed?

- The project config version defined in `hasura.yaml` is bumped from `v1` to `v2`.
- Local dev workflows using Docker have been introduced.
- The DDN CLI commands. See details on the new commands [here](/cli/commands/ddn).
- The local project directory structure.
- `SupergraphManifest` and `ConnectorManifest` objects are now called `Supergraph` and `Connector` respectively.
- The `source` field for `Relationship` objects has been deprecated in favour of the `sourceType` field. Though
  `Relationship` objects with the `source` field will continue to be supported.

We **strongly recommend** you go through our [new getting started guide](/getting-started/overview) to learn about all
the changes and experience the new workflow to develop your API with DDN.

:::info No changes to existing DDN projects

Note that this a CLI only change and does not impact Hasura DDN projects. You can continue using existing DDN projects
and builds and also be able to create new builds using the new CLI revision (with the new local project structure).

:::

## Migrate an existing local project

Below are steps to convert a local project created with the DDN CLI versions `<= v2024.06.05` to the new project
structure.

### Step 1: Get the new CLI

<InstallTheCli revision="v2" />

Also, update your Hasura VS Code extension to `v0.6.x` if not done automatically.

:::info Need the previous CLI revision?

Note that the above will overwrite your current DDN CLI revision. You can re-install the previous revision by replacing
`/ddn/cli/v2/` with `/ddn/cli/v1/` in the above download command.

:::

### Step 2: Set up a fresh local project

#### Step 2.1: Initialize a new supergraph

Run:

```bash
ddn supergraph init --dir <new-proj-dir>
```

Set the default supergraph config file to the CLI context to avoid having to repeat it in future commands. This file
contains the `Supergraph` object similar to the `SupergraphManifest` object in your existing project directory.

```bash
cd <new-proj-dir> && ddn context set supergraph ./supergraph.local.yaml
```

#### Step 2.2: Copy over supergraph global objects

Copy the files containing the supergraph global objects `CompatibilityConfig`, `GraphqlConfig` and `AuthConfig` from
your existing project directory to the `supergraph_globals` directory in the new project directory. These should
typically be in the `supergraph` directory in your existing project directory.

Note that these objects are already created in the `supergraph_globals` directory of your new project directory. The
`AuthConfig` object created here is to be used for local development. To avoid overwriting it, while copying your
`auth-config.hml` file from the existing project directory rename it to `auth-config.cloud.hml` instead. The
`graphql-config.hml` and `compatibility-config.hml` files on the other hand should be overwritten.

### Step 3: Add your subgraphs

For each subgraph in your project:

Follow the below steps:

#### Step 3.1: Initialize the subgraph

Run:

```bash
ddn subgraph init <subgraph-name>
```

#### Step 3.2: Add an env file for deploying to DDN

A `.env.<subgraph-name>` file is created in the `<subgraph-name>` directory to be used during local development.

Create a new file `.env.cloud.<subgraph-name>` alongside it to be used for deployments to DDN. You can leave this file
empty for now.

### Step 4: Set up your data connectors

**Case 1:**

For self-deployed data connectors in your subgraphs, i.e. `ConnectorManifest` of type `endpoints`:

You can skip this step.

**Case 2:**

For each data connector deployed on Hasura DDN in your subgraphs, i.e. `ConnectorManifest` of type `cloud`:

Follow the steps below:

#### Step 4.1: Initialize data connector

Run:

```bash
ddn connector init <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph-name> --hub-connector <connector-type>
```

Ensure you use the same connector name and type from your existing `ConnectorManifest`.

#### Step 4.2: Create connector configuration files for deploying to DDN

##### Step 4.2.1: Create a connector.cloud.yaml

Each connector utilizes a `connector.yaml` file for local development. This file contains the `Connector` object similar
to the `ConnectorManifest` object in your existing project.

To deploy your connector to DDN create a `connector.cloud.yaml` file alongside the connector's local `connector.yaml`.
You can simply copy the contents of the `connector.yaml` file and update the `envFile` key's value to `.env.cloud` which
we'll create now.

```yaml title="For example, <subgraph-name>/connector/<connector-name>/connector.cloud.yaml"
kind: Connector
version: v1
definition:
  name: <connector-name>
  subgraph: <subgraph-name>
  source: hasura/<connector-type>:<version>
  context: .
  #highlight-start
  envFile: .env.cloud
  #highlight-end
```

##### Step 4.2.2: Create a .env.cloud for the connector

Create an environment variable file `.env.cloud` alongside the `.env.local` file for the connector. You can leave this
file empty for now.

#### Step 4.3: Add data connector configuration

##### Case 1: For hasura/postgres connectors

###### Step 4.3.1: Set database connection string

Add a new key `CONNECTION_URI` to the file `<subgraph_name>/connector/<connector_name>/.env.cloud` and set your database
connection string as the value.

For example:

```env
CONNECTION_URI=<your_pg_url>
```

###### Step 4.3.2: Introspect the database schema

Run:

```bash
ddn connector introspect --connector <subgraph-name>/connector/<connector-name>/connector.cloud.yaml
```

##### Case 2: For hasura/nodejs connectors

###### Step 4.3.1: Copy over functions

Copy the file(s) containing your TS functions from your existing project directory to the
`<subgraph-name>/connector/<connector-name>` directory in the new project directory. This file should typically be the
`functions.ts` file in the `<subgraph-name>/<connector-name>/connector` directory in your existing project directory.

### Step 5: Bring over connector related metadata

For each data connector:

Follow the below steps:

#### Step 5.1: Copy over connector related metadata files

Copy the files containing metadata objects related to the connector from your existing project directory to the
`<subgraph-name>/metadata` directory in the new project directory (the directory might need to be created). These files
should typically be in the `<subgraph-name>/<connector-name>` directory in your existing project directory and be
suffixed as `.hml`.

- the file with the `DataConnectorLink` object. Typically `<connector-name>.hml`
- the file with the data connector type objects. Typically `<connector-name>-types.hml`
- the files with Models, Commands, Relationships, etc. Typically in `models`/`commands` directory.

Within the `<subgraph-name>/metadata` directory you can choose to arrange these files however you like.

#### Step 5.2: Update DataConnectorLink object

In the `DataConnectorLink` object replace the `url` section with:

```
url:
    readWriteUrls:
      read:
        valueFromEnv: <CONNECTOR_NAME>_READ_URL
      write:
        valueFromEnv: <CONNECTOR_NAME>_WRITE_URL
```

We will set the values of these env vars in the following steps.

#### Step 5.3: (Optional) Update Relationship objects

As mentioned earlier in the what-has-changed section, the `source` field for `Relationship` objects has been deprecated
in favour of the `sourceType` field. Though `Relationship` objects with the `source` field will continue to be
supported, it is recommended to update them.

To update the relationship objects, rename the `source` key in your objects to `sourceType`.

For example:

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: <rel-name>
  #highlight-start
  sourceType: <source-object-type>
  #highlight-end
  target: ...
```

### Step 6: Deploy to a DDN project

#### Step 6.1: Set the DDN project to deploy to

Run the following command to set your DDN project to the CLI context to avoid having to repeat it in future commands.
You can find your project name in the `hasura.yaml` file in your existing project directory.

```
ddn context set project <project-name>
```

#### Step 6.2: Deploy the data connectors

For each data connector deployed on Hasura DDN in your subgraphs, i.e. `ConnectorManifest` of type `cloud`:

Run:

```bash
ddn connector build create --connector <subgraph-name>/connector/<connector-name>/connector.cloud.yaml
```

On deployment completion, the read and write URLs for your deployed connector will be returned as a response. You will
need these in the next step.

#### Step 6.3: Set connector endpoints in env files

For each subgraph:

Update the file `<subgraph-name>/.env.cloud.<subgraph-name>` with the read and write URLs of the data connectors in the
subgraph.

For a self-deployed data connector in your subgraph, i.e. `ConnectorManifest` of type `endpoints`, use the connector URL
provided in the existing `ConnectorManifest` as both the read and write URLs.

For data connectors deployed on Hasura DDN in your subgraph, use the connector URLs returned in the previous deploy
step.

For example:

```env title="<subgraph-name>/.env.cloud.<subgraph-name>:"
<CONNECTOR_NAME_1>_READ_URL=<connector1-read-url>
<CONNECTOR_NAME_1>_WRITE_URL=<connector1-write-url>
<CONNECTOR_NAME_2>_READ_URL=<connector2-read-url>
<CONNECTOR_NAME_2>_WRITE_URL=<connector2-write-url>
```

#### Step 6.4: Deploy the supergraph

##### Step 6.4.1: Create a supergraph config file for deploying to DDN

In the root of the new project directory, create a new file `supergraph.cloud.yaml` and copy the contents of the
existing `supergraph.yaml` file to it.

Update the following values in the new file:

- `./supergraph_globals/auth-config.hml` -> To the name of the AuthConfig file copied earlier. e.g.
  `./supergraph_globals/auth-config.cloud.hml`
- For each subgraph: `envFile: <subgraph-name>/.env.<subgraph-name>` -> To the name of the cloud env files created
  earlier. e.g. `envFile: <subgraph-name>/.env.cloud.<subgraph-name>`

For example:

```yaml title="supergraph.cloud.yaml"
kind: Supergraph
version: v1
definition:
  supergraph_globals:
    generator:
      rootPath: ./supergraph_globals
    envFile: ./supergraph_globals/.env.supergraph_globals
    includePaths:
      #highlight-start
      - ./supergraph_globals/auth-config.cloud.hml
      #highlight-end
      - ./supergraph_globals/compatibility-config.hml
      - ./supergraph_globals/graphql-config.hml
  subgraphs:
    <subgraph-name>:
      generator:
        rootPath: <subgraph-name>/metadata
      #highlight-start
      envFile: <subgraph-name>/.env.cloud.<subgraph-name>
      #highlight-end
      includePaths:
        - <subgraph-name>/metadata
```

##### Step 6.4.2: Build and deploy your supergraph

Run:

```bash
ddn supergraph build create --supergraph ./supergraph.cloud.yaml
```

On build completion, the build version, API endpoint and console URLs will be returned as response.

#### Step 6.5: Verify migration

You can now head to your project console using the console URL returned in the previous step and verify the API
generated with the above build is the same as what you had earlier.

| [`supergraph`](#supergraph)                  | A directory, containing all the necessary configuration and metadata files, for the supergraph-level scope of a project.   |
| [`<SUBGRAPH_DIRECTORY>`](#subgraphs)         | A directory, containing all the necessary configuration and metadata files, for a corresponding subgraph within a project. |

#### hasura.yaml

This is the entrypoint to a Hasura project.

```yaml
version: v1
project: <PROJECT_NAME>
subgraphs:
  app:
    path: ./app
defaultSupergraphManifest: base
```

The `version` section is used to specify the version of the configuration file. The `project` field is used to specify
the project name.

The `hasura.yaml` file also contains a `subgraphs` section. This section is used to specify the various
[subgraphs](#subgraphs) associated with the project.

#### \*.env.yaml

This file is used to store environment variables. The CLI generates a `base.env.yaml` for you by default. You can add
environment variables by adding key-value pairs under a particular subgraph:

```yaml
supergraph: {}
subgraphs:
  #highlight-start
  app:
    APP_CONNECTOR_CONNECTION_URI: "CONNECTION_URI"
#highlight-end
```

And then referencing them in your metadata using `valueFromEnv`:

```yaml
kind: ConnectorManifest
version: v1
spec:
  supergraphManifests:
    - base
definition:
  name: app_connector
  type: cloud
  connector:
    type: hub
    name: <CONNECTOR_NAME>
  deployments:
    - context: .
      env:
        CONNECTION_URI:
          #highlight-start
          valueFromEnv: APP_CONNECTOR_CONNECTION_URI
#highlight-end
```

:::info Accessing environment variables

In the example above, our `supergraphManifests` array references our `base.supergraph.hml` file, which contains an
`envfile` key that maps to our `base.env.yaml`. Thus, any environment variables present in this YAML file will then be
accessible in our HML.

If these files contain sensitive information, you should add them to your gitignore so as to avoid accidentally
committing them to version control.

:::

#### Supergraph manifests {#supergraph-manifests}

Supergraph manifests tell Hasura DDN how to construct your supergraph. A manifest will contain information such as which
subgraphs to include and which resources to use for the build.

```yaml
kind: SupergraphManifest
version: v1
definition:
  name: base
  envfile: base.env.yaml
  subgraphs:
    - app
```

#### Supergraph

The `supergraph` directory contains the supergraph configuration files. The three included files are:

```bash
├── auth-config.hml
├── compatibility-config.hml
└── graphql-config.hml
```

:::info Organizing files

The contents of these files include the necessary metadata objects to build your supergraph. We've separated them out
into files organized by their purpose, but you can organize them anyway you like so long as the metadata objects within
them are all included.

:::

Each of these files' contents are used to configure the supergraph.

The `auth-config.hml` file contains the authentication configuration for the supergraph, allowing you to utilize either
JWTs or webhooks.

The `compatibility-config.hml` file contains the compatibility configuration — using a version number — for the
supergraph.

The `graphql-config.hml` file contains the GraphQL configuration for the supergraph, which allows you to customize the
available query and mutation capabilities along with the schema.

#### Subgraphs

Each subgraph is listed as a top-level directory in the root of the project. The CLI will init your project with an
`app` subgraph.

Each subgraph directory will contain the following folder structure when a new connector manifest is added for the
subgraph:

```bash
└── <CONNECTOR_NAME>
│   ├── <CONNECTOR_NAME>-types.hml
│   ├── <CONNECTOR_NAME>.hml
│   ├── connector
│   │   ├── <CONNECTOR_NAME>.build.hml
│   │   ├── configuration.json
│   │   └── schema.json
│   └── models
```

| File/Folder                             | Description                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<CONNECTOR_NAME>`                      | The directory containing the build artifacts for the connector.                    |
| `<CONNECTOR_NAME>-types.html`           | The metadata file for the connector's types.                                       |
| `<CONNECTOR_NAME>.hml`                  | The metadata file for the connector based on the introspection of the data source. |
| `<CONNECTOR_NAME>/configuration.json`   | The configuration file for the connector.                                          |
| `<CONNECTOR_NAME>/schema.json`          | The schema file for the connector.                                                 |
| `/connector/<CONNECTOR_NAME>.build.hml` | The build manifest for the connector.                                              |
