# Deprecated Metadata Upgrades

Codemods can upgrade your metadata to the latest version so you can take advantage of the latest engine features.

Codemods below are listed with the CLI version they were added in.

## `upgrade-object-boolean-expression-types` (v2.4.0)

Upgrades the deprecated [`ObjectBooleanExpressionType`](/supergraph-modeling/boolean-expressions.mdx#objectbooleanexpressiontype-objectbooleanexpressiontype) to the new [`BooleanExpressionType`](/supergraph-modeling/boolean-expressions.mdx).

This enables filtering Models on nested objects and arrays, and based on relationships.

```bash
ddn codemod upgrade-object-boolean-expression-types
```

By default the codemod will run against the supergraph.yaml from the context. Provide `--supergraph` or `--subgraph` to run the codemod against a different supergraph or subgraph.

## `upgrade-graphqlconfig-aggregate` (v2.4.0)

Add aggregates support to metadata through [`AggregateExpression`](/supergraph-modeling/aggregate-expressions). Use aggregates (like sum, min, count, etc) in your GraphQL API.

```bash
ddn codemod upgrade-graphqlconfig-aggregate
```

By default the codemod will run against the supergraph.yaml from the context.

The `GraphqlConfig` metadata object is required to be upgraded to enable aggregates for all subgraphs.

Run against a specific supergraph.yaml or subgraph.yaml file

```bash
ddn codemod upgrade-graphqlconfig-aggregate --supergraph ./supergraph.cloud.yaml
ddn codemod upgrade-graphqlconfig-aggregate --subgraph ./app/subgraph.yaml
```
