# Fix the OTLP endpoint environment variable

## What has happened?

In DDN CLI versions **v2.7.0** and below, the environment variable `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`
was used to configure the endpoint for sending traces from connectors. However, this environment variable
is not supported by all Hasura connectors. Starting with CLI v2.7.1, the environment variable 
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is now used, which is supported by all Hasura connectors.

## What has changed?

When DDN CLI initializes a connector using `ddn connector init` the environment variable `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`
is used instead of `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` in `connector.yaml` and `compose.yaml` files.

## Migrate an existing project
To start using this new feature in an existing project:

1. Update your CLI to the latest version.
```bash
ddn update-cli
```
2. Run codemod from Hasura project directory to update the name of the environment variables
```bash
ddn codemod fix-traces-env-var --dir .
```

This will fix the name of the environment variables in the connector configuration files and docker compose files.

## Verifying the changes

To verify that the traces are working correctly,

1. Run the local engine using `ddn run docker-start`
2. Open local console using `ddn console --local`
3. Execute a GraphQL query
4. Click on 'View Trace' and verify that the traces from the connector are also shown
