# Upgrading to supergraph config v2

## What has happened?

A new revision (**v1.0.0**) of the [DDN CLI](/cli/installation.mdx) has been released with some changes to the project
directory structure and CLI commands. With this release, local project directory structures created by CLI versions
**\<= 2024.07.09** are now deprecated.

This page contains some information on what has changed and instructions to migrate your existing local projects.

## What has changed?

- The project directory structure
  - See details on the updated directory structure [here](/project-configuration/config).
  - The `Supergraph` object is upgraded from `v1` to `v2`.
  - A `Subgraph` object is introduced to define how to build a subgraph.
  - The `AuthConfig`, `GraphqlConfig` and `CompatibilityConfig` metadata objects are now not defined as supergraph
    globals but can instead be defined in any subgraph of the supergraph. Note that these are still supergraph-level
    objects and only one of these objects can be defined across the supergraph, but they can now be defined in any of
    the subgraphs based on convenience. By default, these are now added to a new **globals** subgraph.
- The `--subgraph` flag in DDN CLI commands now accepts a path to a subgraph config file as opposed to the subgraph
  name.
- The DDN CLI now uses [SemVer](https://semver.org/) instead of CalVer for versioning.
- The `otel-collector` version is now updated to the latest version and the `otel-collector-config.yaml` is now updated
  accordingly.

:::info No changes to existing DDN projects

Note that this is a CLI-only change and does not impact Hasura DDN projects. You can continue using existing DDN
projects and builds and also be able to create new builds on them with both the new and old CLI revisions.

Though we strongly recommend updating to the latest version of the CLI and project structure by following the steps
below.

:::

## Migrate an existing local project

Below are steps to convert a local project created with the DDN CLI versions `<= v2024.07.09` to the new project
structure.

### Step 1: Get the new CLI

<InstallTheCli />

Also, update your Hasura VS Code extension to `v1.0.0` if not done automatically.

:::info Need the previous CLI revision?

Note that the above will overwrite your current DDN CLI revision. You can re-install the previous revision by replacing
`/ddn/cli/v3/` with `/ddn/cli/v2/` in the above download command. :::

### Step 2: Upgrade existing Supergraph config v1 objects

You can update your existing Supergraph config v1 objects in your local project by running the following in your project
directory:

```bash
ddn codemod upgrade-supergraph-config-v1-to-v2 --dir <project-dir-path>
```

This will detect any existing Supergraph v1 objects in your project directory and initialize a wizard to update them to
the v2 format and make any other related changes, such as initializing the newly introduced Subgraph config objects and
setting up the new **globals** subgraph.

### Step 3: Create new **globals** subgraph on the DDN project

Run the following command to create a new **globals** subgraph on your DDN project:

```bash
ddn project subgraph create globals --project <project-name>
```

### Step 4: Verify the migration

Create a new supergraph build using:

```bash
ddn supergraph build create --supergraph ./supergraph.cloud.yaml
```

On build completion, the build version, API endpoint, and console URLs will be returned as in the response.

You can now head to your project console using the console URL returned in the previous step and verify the API
generated with the above build is the same as what you had earlier.

### Step 5: Update the OpenTelemetry exporter config

Replace the contents of the file `otel-collector-config.yaml` (present at the root of the project by default) with the
following:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: https://gateway.otlp.hasura.io:443
    headers:
      Authorization: pat ${env:HASURA_DDN_PAT}
processors:
  batch: {}
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      exporters:
        - otlp
      processors:
        - batch
      receivers:
        - otlp
    metrics:
      exporters:
        - otlp
      processors:
        - batch
      receivers:
        - otlp
    traces:
      exporters:
        - otlp
      processors:
        - batch
      receivers:
        - otlp
```

You can now pin the version of `otel-collector` to a specific version (say `0.104.0`) to ensure breaking changes to the
OpenTelemetry collector config does not affect your local dev by setting the field `$.services.otel-collector.image` in
the `docker-compose.hasura.yaml` file to `otel/opentelemetry-collector:0.104.0`.
