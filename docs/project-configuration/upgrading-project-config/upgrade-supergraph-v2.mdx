# Upgrading to supergraph config v2

## What has happened?

A new revision (**v1.x.x**) of the [DDN CLI](/cli/installation.mdx) has been released with some changes to the project
directory structure and CLI commands. With this release, local project directory structures created by CLI versions
**\<= 2024.07.09** are now deprecated.

This page contains some information on what has changed and instructions to migrate your existing local projects.

:::warning A newer CLI version has been released since!

A newer revision (**v2.x.x**) of the [DDN CLI](/cli/installation.mdx) has been released. See the upgrade guide
[here](project-configuration/upgrading-project-config/upgrade-project-v3.mdx).

If your local project was created by CLI versions **\< v2.0.0**, you will need to update your local project
directory using this current guide first before upgrading to the above revision.

:::

## What has changed?

- The project directory structure
  - See details on the updated directory structure [here](/project-configuration/config).
  - The `Supergraph` object is upgraded from `v1` to `v2`.
  - A `Subgraph` object is introduced to define how to build a subgraph.
  - The `AuthConfig`, `GraphqlConfig` and `CompatibilityConfig` metadata objects are now not defined as supergraph
    globals but can instead be defined in any subgraph of the supergraph. Note that these are still supergraph-level
    objects and only one of these objects can be defined across the supergraph, but they can now be defined in any of
    the subgraphs based on convenience. By default, these are now added to a new **globals** subgraph.
- The `--subgraph` flag in DDN CLI commands now accepts a path to a subgraph config file as opposed to the subgraph
  name.
- The DDN CLI now uses [SemVer](https://semver.org/) instead of CalVer for versioning.
- The `otel-collector` version is now updated to the latest version and the `otel-collector-config.yaml` is now updated
  accordingly.

:::info No changes to existing DDN projects

Note that this is a CLI-only change and does not impact Hasura DDN projects. You can continue using existing DDN
projects and builds and also be able to create new builds on them with both the new and old CLI revisions.

Though we strongly recommend updating to the latest version of the CLI and project structure by following the steps
below.

:::

## Migrate an existing local project

Below are steps to convert a local project created with the DDN CLI versions `<= v2024.07.09` to the new project
structure.

### Step 1: Get the new CLI

<InstallTheCli revision="v3" />

Also, update your Hasura VS Code extension to `v1.x.x` if not done automatically.

:::info Need the previous CLI revision?

Note that the above will overwrite your current DDN CLI revision. You can re-install the previous revision by replacing
`/ddn/cli/v3/` with `/ddn/cli/v2/` in the above download command.

:::

### Step 2: Upgrade existing Supergraph config v1 objects

You can update your existing Supergraph config v1 objects in your local project by running the following in your project
directory:

```bash
ddn codemod upgrade-supergraph-config-v1-to-v2 --dir <project-dir-path>
```

This will detect any existing Supergraph v1 objects in your project directory and initialize a wizard to update them to
the v2 format and make any other related changes, such as initializing the newly introduced Subgraph config objects and
setting up the new **globals** subgraph.

### Step 3: Create new **globals** subgraph on the DDN project

Run the following command to create a new **globals** subgraph on your DDN project:

```bash
ddn project subgraph create globals --project <project-name>
```

### Step 4: Verify the migration

Create a new supergraph build using:

```bash
ddn supergraph build create --supergraph ./supergraph.cloud.yaml
```

On build completion, the build version, API endpoint, and console URLs will be returned as in the response.

You can now head to your project console using the console URL returned in the previous step and verify the API
generated with the above build is the same as what you had earlier.

### Step 5: Update the OpenTelemetry exporter config

Replace the contents of the file `otel-collector-config.yaml` (present at the root of the project by default) with the
following:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: https://gateway.otlp.hasura.io:443
    headers:
      Authorization: pat ${env:HASURA_DDN_PAT}
processors:
  batch: {}
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      exporters:
        - otlp
      processors:
        - batch
      receivers:
        - otlp
    metrics:
      exporters:
        - otlp
      processors:
        - batch
      receivers:
        - otlp
    traces:
      exporters:
        - otlp
      processors:
        - batch
      receivers:
        - otlp
```

You can now pin the version of `otel-collector` to a specific version (say `0.104.0`) to ensure breaking changes to the
OpenTelemetry collector config does not affect your local dev by setting the field `$.services.otel-collector.image` in
the `docker-compose.hasura.yaml` file to `otel/opentelemetry-collector:0.104.0`.

#### hasura.yaml {#hasurayaml}

`hasura.yaml` appears at the root of a Hasura project.

For example:

```yaml
version: v2
```

- `version` specifies the version of the project directory structure.

#### .env.\* {#envfiles}

This file is used to store environment variables. The file should be in the format:

```.env
ENV1=val1
ENV2=val2
```

These files are referenced inside:

- Docker Compose files: Docker Compose files use \*.env files to specify environment variables needed for containers.
- Subgraph files: Subgraph files use \*.env files to specify environment variables. This is needed by `globals` and
other subgraphs. Each subgraph can have its own .env file.
- Connector files (such as `connector.yaml`): Connector files use \*.env files to specify environment variables needed
for building the connector.

#### supergraph.\*.yaml {#supergraph-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to construct your supergraph. It will contain information such as which subgraph
config files to use for building the supergraph

For example:

```yaml
kind: Supergraph
version: v2
definition:
  subgraphs:
    - globals/subgraph.cloud.yaml
    - app/subgraph.yaml
```

- `version` is the version of the supergraph object
- `subgraphs` specifies paths to all the subgraph config files. These are then read recursively to construct the
metadata for the supergraph.

By default, the CLI generates two files - `supergraph.cloud.yaml` and `supergraph.local.yaml` but any number of
supergraph config files can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

#### subgraph.\*.yaml {#subgraph-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to construct your subgraph. It will contain information such as which metadata
resources to use for the build.

For example:

```yaml
kind: Subgraph
version: v1
definition:
  name: app
  generator:
    rootPath: .
  includePaths:
    - metadata
```

- `version` is the version of the subgraph object
- `includePaths` specifies the directories and files where metadata for the subgraph can be found. If a directory is
specified, all the \*.hml files inside the directory and its subdirectories will be used to construct the metadata.
- `generator.rootPath` specifies the directory into which any new files will be generated.

By default, the CLI generates a file called `subgraph.yaml` for a new subgraph but any number of subgraph config files
can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

#### connector.\*.yaml {#connector-config}

These config files tell Hasura DDN how to build your connector. It will contain information such as the type of
connector and the location to the context files needed to build the connector.

For example:

```yaml
kind: Connector
version: v1
definition:
  name: mypg
  source: hasura/postgres:v0.7.0
  context: .
  envFile: .env.local
```

- `version` is the version of the connector object
- `name` is a name given to the connector
- `source` is the connector to use specific to the data source
- `context` specifies the connector directory
- `envFile` specifies the connector specific environment variables to use for introspecting and building the connector.
If you are deploying your connector on DDN cloud, you also need to specify `subgraph`. Value of this field is name of
the subgraph you want to deploy your connector to.

By default, the CLI generates two files - `connector.cloud.yaml` and `connector.local.yaml` but any number of connector
config files can be created and referenced in CLI commands.

#### .hasura/context.yaml {#context-file}

This specifies the default DDN project and supergraph file path. The default values are used by all commands that accept
`--supergraph` flag, `--subgraph` flag and `--project` flag. The flags can be used to override the default values.

```yaml
context:
  project: emerging-stag-9129
  supergraph: ../supergraph.cloud.yaml
  subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
```

This file is configured by the `ddn context set` command.

#### Engine {#engine}

The `engine` directory contains the files required for Hasura v3 engine container. This directory has the following
structure:

```bash
├── .env.engine
├── auth_config.json
├── metadata.json
└── open_dd.json
```

The `.env.engine` file specifies environment variables required by the Hasura v3 engine container.

The `auth_config.json`, `metadata.json` and `open_dd.json` are generated as a result of `ddn supergraph build local`
command and do not need to be edited by the user.

#### Globals {#globals}

The `globals` directory contains the files for the **globals** subgraph which is generated by default to hold the
supergraph-level metadata objects, i.e. `AuthConfig`, `GraphqlConfig` and `CompatibilityConfig`.

For example:

```bash
├── .env.globals.cloud
├── .env.globals.local
├── auth-config.cloud.hml
├── auth-config.local.hml
├── compatibility-config.hml
├── graphql-config.hml
├── subgraph.cloud.yaml
└── subgraph.local.yaml
```

- `auth-config.cloud.hml` and `auth-config.local.hml` files contain the `AuthConfig` object which define the
authentication configuration for the supergraph for cloud and local deployments respectively.
- `compatibility-config.hml` file contains the compatibility date configuration for the supergraph.
- `graphql-config.hml` file contains the GraphQL configuration for the supergraph, which allows you to customize the
available query and mutation capabilities along with the schema.
- `.env.globals.cloud` and `.env.globals.local` files contain all the environment variables, if any, which are required
by the **globals** subgraph's metadata objects for cloud and local deployments respectively.
