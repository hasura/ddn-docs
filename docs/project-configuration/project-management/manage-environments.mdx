# Alternative Configuration Files per Environment

## Introduction

Following on from setting up and
[managing multiple contexts](/project-configuration/project-management/manage-contexts.mdx), you can also specify
different configuration files per environment. This is useful if you want to use different setups for each.

## Example

For example, if in `development` you want to use `noAuth` mode but for `staging` and `production` you want to use JWT
mode, you can create a supergraph config file for each environment and then specify the correct file in the context.

In the following example we have a `supergraph-development.yaml` file which specifies a chain to the
`subgraph-development.yaml` to the `metadata_development` directory to include for the metadata which sets the `noAuth`
mode for development context.

```yaml title="supergraph-development.yaml"
kind: Supergraph
version: v2
definition:
  subgraphs:
    # highlight-start
    - globals/subgraph-development.yaml
    # highlight-end
    - my_subgraph/subgraph.yaml
```

```yaml title="globals/subgraph-development.yaml"
kind: Subgraph
version: v2
definition:
  name: globals
  generator:
    rootPath: .
  # highlight-start
  includePaths:
    - metadata_development
  # highlight-end
```

```yaml title="globals/metadata_development/auth-config.hml"
kind: AuthConfig
version: v3
definition:
  mode:
    noAuth:
      role: admin
      sessionVariables: {}
```

Then similarly, we would have the supergraph file for the other environments to use which specifies JWT mode in the
`auth-config.yaml` file. You can read more about [auth here](/auth/overview.mdx).
