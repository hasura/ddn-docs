# How to Manage Project Contexts

## Introduction

Contexts simplify your development workflow by making CLI commands more concise and ensuring easy transitions between
environments. They act as predefined configurations that the CLI uses to interact with specific sets of values, making
processes like deploying, testing, or managing your project in CI/CD pipelines easier.

You can manage your project's contexts using the `.hasura/context.yaml` file, which is generated in the root of your
project when the CLI initializes it.

## Contexts

By default, the CLI sets up your project with a `default` context. To add new contexts, use the
[`create-context` CLI command](/reference/cli/commands/ddn_context_create-context.mdx).

For a full list of context-related commands, refer to
[this category of commands](/reference/cli/commands/ddn_context.mdx). Although you can modify these values directly in
the file, we recommend using the CLI for consistency and ease. Examples are provided below.

### Project

The `project` key-value pair can be mapped to a Hasura DDN cloud project. This is used to dictate which cloud-hosted
project should be referenced by the CLI when cloud-based and project-related commands are executed.

```yaml title="When the default context is set, the great-ddn-1234 project will be used by the CLI:"
contexts:
  default:
    #highlight-start
    project: great-ddn-1234
    #highlight-end
    supergraph: ../supergraph.yaml
    subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
    localEnvFile: ../.env
    cloudEnvFile: ../.env.cloud
```

When you initialize a new Hasura Cloud project, the `project` key-value will automatically be set by the CLI. You can
also override this manually using [the `ddn context set` command](/reference/cli/commands/ddn_context_set.mdx).

This key-value pair simplifies switching contexts across development stages. For instance, the `default` context could
be used for production builds, while a separate `staging` context could map to a dedicated project for API collaboration
and testing before moving to production.

### Supergraph

The `supergraph` key-value pair maps to a
[Supergraph metadata object](supergraph-modeling/build-configs.mdx#supergraph-supergraph), which contains a list of the
subgraphs to include in any supergraph build.

```yaml title="When the default context is set, the root supergraph.yaml will be used by the CLI:"
contexts:
  default:
    project: great-ddn-1234
    #highlight-start
    supergraph: ../supergraph.yaml
    #highlight-end
    subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
    localEnvFile: ../.env
    cloudEnvFile: ../.env.cloud
```

By default, this is set to the root `supergraph.yaml` when you initialize a local project. However, you can customize
this to use any valid Supergraph metadata object.

As with subgraphs below, setting this value makes any supergraph-related CLI commands more concise by eliminating the
need for extra flags.

### Subgraph

The `subgraph` key-value pair maps to a
[Subgraph metadata object](supergraph-modeling/build-configs.mdx#subgraph-subgraph) which contains information about
which connectors are included in the subgraph and mappings for environment variables.

```yaml title="With the configuration below, if the current context is default, the app/subgraph.yaml configuration file will be used:"
contexts:
  default:
    project: great-ddn-1234
    supergraph: ../supergraph.yaml
    #highlight-start
    subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
    #highlight-end
    localEnvFile: ../.env
    cloudEnvFile: ../.env.cloud
```

For projects with multiple subgraphs, it's handy to use this command to switch between subgraphs:

```sh
ddn context set subgraph <path-to-subgraph-configuration-file>
```

This ensures common actions — like adding data connectors and generating metadata after introspection — are executed by
the CLI in the correct subgraph, keeping your supergraph organized and resources with their appropriate owners.

### localEnvFile

Your project is initialized with a root-level `.env` file and this is automatically set in the `default` context.
Whenever a new environment variable is added — such as when initializing a new connector — the CLI will add the
appropriate key-value pairs to this file. It is used in local development such as when running your local services
(i.e., the engine and connectors).

```yaml title="When the default context is set, the root .env file will be used by the CLI for any local development commands:"
contexts:
  default:
    project: great-ddn-1234
    supergraph: ../supergraph.yaml
    subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
    #highlight-start
    localEnvFile: ../.env
    #highlight-end
    cloudEnvFile: ../.env.cloud
```

Ideally, the values here will — such as connection strings to data sources — will be mapped to development instances,
whether that be locally or hosted elsewhere. This makes it easy to work with what will eventually become a production
build, but using local resources for quicker iteration and shorter feedback loops.

Any time you need to add additional environment variables to a connector, you can
[use the CLI](/reference/cli/commands/ddn_connector_env_add.mdx).

### cloudEnvFile

Your project includes a root-level `.env.cloud` file, which is automatically set in the current context whenever a new
cloud project is initialized. This file is specifically used for cloud-related operations, such as deploying or managing
your services in a cloud environment.

```yaml title="When the default context is set, the root .env.cloud file will be used by the CLI for any cloud-related commands:"
contexts:
  default:
    project: great-ddn-1234
    supergraph: ../supergraph.yaml
    subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
    localEnvFile: ../.env
    #highlight-start
    cloudEnvFile: ../.env.cloud
    #highlight-end
```

:::tip A localEnvFile is required before setting the cloudEnvFile

A `localEnvFile` is required before setting the `cloudEnvFile`. Ensure your `localEnvFile` is set for the current
context **before** initializing a new cloud project to avoid any deployment issues.
