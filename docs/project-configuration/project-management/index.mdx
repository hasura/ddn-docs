# Project Management

## Introduction

Broadly, projects can be managed using two tools: context and collaborators.

**Context** allows you to swap out local and cloud configuration files and values. This makes it easier to execute
commands via the CLI, switch between environments when testing your API, and executing automated CI/CD scripts.

**Collaborators** can be added to any [Hasura DDN Base or Hasura DDN Advanced project](https://hasura.io/pricing).
Depending on the project's plan, you can add collaborators with read-only access all the way to granular access,
enabling them to only contribute to certain [subgraphs](/project-configuration/subgraphs/index.mdx).
