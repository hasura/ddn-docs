# How to Work with Multiple Subgraphs

## Introduction

In your daily development, you'll often encounter scenarios where your project requires multiple subgraphs to represent
distinct domains. We'll walk you through the best practices for working with multiple subgraphs, setting their context,
and establishing relationships across them to create a unified supergraph.

## Set subgraph context

If you're working in a project with multiple subgraphs, there will be the need to switch between subgraphs when
executing commands with the DDN CLI. While the CLI supports a `--subgraph` flag, it is much more convenient to set your
subgraph in context.

```sh title="Switch between context using the path to the subgraph's configuration file:"
ddn context set subgraph ./<subgraph-name>/subgraph.yaml
```

```sh title="You can verify this by checking the current context:"
ddn context get subgraph
```

Which should return the path you entered. This will ensure any commands you run — such as adding a new data connector —
are run in the appropriate subgraph.

## Create relationships across subgraphs

Within any model's HML file, you can add a [relationship object](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx) as you normally
would **but add a `subgraph` key-value pair** identifying in which subgraph the model is located.

```yaml tile="For example, a billing subgraph:"
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: orders
  sourceType: Users
  target:
    model:
      #highlight-start
      subgraph: billing
      #highlight-end
      name: Orders
      relationshipType: Array
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: id
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: userId
```

:::info Considerations for multi-repository projects

[Hasura's VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) assists in authoring
metadata objects like the one above. It offers autocomplete and knows about your metadata, enabling validation and short
feedback loops for you as developer. However, when in a multi-repository project wherein subgraphs are split among
various repositories, the extension will only be able assist with the metadata which is locally available.

For more information, see the next steps section below.
