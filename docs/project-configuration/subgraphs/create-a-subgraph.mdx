# How to Create a Subgraph

## Introduction

You can easily create subgraphs using the CLI and — for cloud projects — the Hasura DDN console.

## In your local metadata {#local}

```sh title="Within a local project directory, run the following:"
ddn subgraph init <subgraph-name>
```

You can verify this by identifying the new subdirectory in your project with the subgraph's name.

```sh title="Then, add the subgraph to your supergraph's config file:"
ddn subgraph add <subgraph-name> --subgraph ./<subgraph-name>/subgraph.yaml --target-supergraph ./supergraph.yaml
```

```sh title="This will add the new subgraph to your supergraph.yaml:"
kind: Supergraph
version: v2
definition:
  subgraphs:
    - globals/subgraph.yaml
    - app/subgraph.yaml
    # highlight-start
    - <subgraph-name>/subgraph.yaml
    # highlight-end
```

## On a cloud project {#cloud}

By default, when a cloud project is initialized, any subgraphs present in your supergraph configuration will be
initialized as well. However, to explicitly add a new subgraph to a cloud project — such as when iterating on an
existing project — follow these steps:

### Using the CLI

```sh title="The folowing will create a new subgraph on the current context's cloud project:"
ddn project subgraph create <subgraph-name>
```

### Using the console

Under `Settings` > `Subgraphs` click `+ Create New Subgraph`.

:::info Subgraph mapping

Be careful of mismatching subgraphs between your local metadata and a cloud project: if you create a subgraph locally
and add it to your supergraph configuration without also creating the subgraph on your cloud project, cloud builds will
fail.

To resolve this, ensure that when you create a local subgraph in your metadata, you also create the companion subgraph
on the cloud project.
