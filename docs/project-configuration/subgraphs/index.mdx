# Subgraphs

## Introduction

A subgraph is a focused component of your overall supergraph, typically organized around specific data domains or
business functions.

Subgraphs are often team-specific, aligning with the responsibilities and expertise of individual teams. This structure
not only enables efficient development but also makes it easier to onboard new teams as your unified supergraph evolves.
By defining clear boundaries and responsibilities, subgraphs allow new teams to integrate seamlessly without impacting
existing functionality, fostering a scalable and collaborative development environment.

## Organization

Subgraphs provide flexibility and modularity in API development. A single project can include one or more subgraphs,
depending on its complexity and the distribution of responsibilities among teams. Subgraphs are designed to be iterated
on and developed independently, allowing teams to work at their own pace and with their own preferred tools and
languages without interfering with the broader system.

In setups with multiple repositories, subgraphs also enhance governance by limiting access. Individual developers or
teams are only granted permissions to their specific subgraph, ensuring they cannot modify or disrupt other parts of the
API. This separation not only protects the integrity of the overall system but also enables streamlined collaboration
across teams by maintaining a well-defined scope of access.
