# How to Split Subgraphs across Repositories

## Introduction

You can split your subgraphs into multiple repositories while unifying them under a single "parent" project.

:::warning DDN Advanced Plan required

In order to utilize multi-repository collaboration, you must have an active
[DDN Advanced Plan](https://hasura.io/pricing).

:::

## Create the Initial Project

Begin by creating a "parent" project that will serve as the coordinated supergraph for your independent subgraph
repositories. This central project will manage provisioning subgraphs, inviting collaborators, and maintaining the
overall API.

### Step 1. Initialize a New Local Project

```sh
ddn supergraph init <parent-project> && cd <parent-project> && git init
```

This will scaffold the local configuration for your DDN project and initialize a Git repository.

### Step 2. Create a Cloud Project

```sh
ddn project init
```

In your configuration file (e.g., `.hasura/context.yaml`), you'll see a new `project` entry with the name of the project
returned by the CLI.

### Step 3. Create an Initial Commit

```sh
git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Push this repository to your preferred hosting service to share it with collaborators.

### Step 4. Provision Subgraphs

If you know the subgraphs to include, you can provision them using the DDN CLI. Replace `<subgraph-name>` with the
desired name:

```sh
ddn project subgraph create <subgraph-name>
```

:::info On-Demand Subgraphs

Subgraphs can be added as needed when collaborators are onboarded.

:::

### Step 5. Create a Base Build

```sh
ddn supergraph build create
```

This initial build serves as the foundation for future subgraph builds.

### Step 6. Invite Collaborators

Navigate to your project's console and invite collaborators based on their roles:

| Role      | Description                                                                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin     | Users with permissions to manage builds and deploy them to the parent project's endpoint.                       |
| Developer | Developers responsible for implementing features and making iterative changes to their respective sub-projects. |

Each collaborator will receive an invitation to join the project and can proceed to add their subgraphs.

## Add Independent Subgraphs to the Project

Each subgraph resides in its own repository. This could be an existing repository or a newly initialized one.

### Step 1. Create a New Repository for a Subgraph

```sh
ddn supergraph init <subgraph-name> --create-subgraph <subgraph-name> && cd <subgraph-name> && git init
```

This scaffolds the necessary structure and initializes a Git repository.

### Step 2. Map the Subgraph to the Parent Project

```sh
ddn project init --with-project <parent-project-name>
```

Your configuration file will now link this subgraph to the parent project.

:::info Local Development

You can add data sources and develop locally at this point. Check out relevant tutorials for adding sources.

:::

### Step 3. Set the Subgraph Context

```sh
ddn context set subgraph ./<subgraph-name>/subgraph.yaml
```

This sets the subgraph configuration for the CLI.

### Step 4. Create a Subgraph Build

```sh
ddn subgraph build create
```

The CLI returns a build version for integration into the parent project.

### Step 5. Integrate the Subgraph Build into the Parent Project

```sh
ddn supergraph build get
```

Use the latest build version from the parent project and the subgraph build version in the following command:

```sh
ddn supergraph build create --subgraph-version <subgraph-name:build-version> --base-supergraph-version <parent-build-id>
```

This integrates the subgraph changes into the parent project.

### Step 6. Apply the Build

```sh
ddn supergraph build apply <supergraph-build-version>
```

This finalizes the integration, making the changes available to all collaborators.
