# Subgraphs

## Introduction

Subgraphs allow you to manage your Hasura metadata more efficiently by allowing it to be split based on ownership.

A project can have multiple subgraphs and the project metadata becomes the 'union' of the metadata across all
subgraphs of the project. Each subgraph can then be managed independently.

## Create a new subgraph

You can create a subgraph for a project on Hasura DDN using the CLI by running:

```bash
ddn project subgraph create <subgraph-name> --project <project-name>
```

## List all subgraphs

You can list all the subgraphs for a project using the CLI by running:

```bash
ddn project subgraph get --project <project-name>
```

## Delete a subgraph

You can delete a subgraph for a project using the CLI by running:

```bash
ddn project subgraph delete <subbgraph-name>  --project <project-name>
```
