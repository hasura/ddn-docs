# Projects

## Introduction

A **project** in Hasura DDN is the foundation for building and managing your API. It contains a structured collection of
metadata files that define the behavior, relationships, and permissions for your API. These metadata files are organized
into **subgraphs**, each representing a distinct data domain.

Projects are designed to support both local development and cloud deployment. During development, you work with a local
version of your project, which is linked to a cloud project through a context file. This linkage enables seamless
development, testing, and deployment workflows. You can also define multiple contexts (e.g., `staging`) to manage
different environments, with unique configurations for environment variables and cloud resources.

Projects are flexible and extensible. For example, you can use engine plugins to modify the behavior of the Hasura DDN
engine, tailoring it to your specific needs at any stage of the development process.

## Data domains

A **data domain** in Hasura DDN represents a distinct area of responsibility or focus within your project, typically
aligned with a specific team or business function. These domains are managed as **subgraphs**, which are collections of
metadata files that describe the relationships, permissions, and structure for the data within that domain.

Organizing your project into subgraphs provides several benefits:

- **Team Ownership**: Each team can focus on their own data domain without interfering with others, making collaboration
  simpler and reducing bottlenecks.
- **Clear Boundaries**: Subgraphs establish clear boundaries between domains, making it easier to define and enforce
  data access permissions and relationships.
- **Scalability**: By breaking your project into manageable pieces, you can scale your API incrementally as your
  organization and data requirements grow.
- **Flexibility**: Subgraphs can be independently updated and extended, allowing you to adapt your project to changing
  needs without disrupting the overall API.

This structure ensures that your project remains organized, collaborative, and adaptable, enabling you to build and
maintain robust APIs efficiently.

:::info Multi-repo projects

Hasura DDN also supports multi-repository setups, giving teams greater autonomy in their development process. With this
setup:

- Each team can maintain their **subgraph** in a separate repository while still contributing to the shared
  **supergraph**.
- Teams can develop, test, and deploy their subgraphs independently, enabling faster iteration and minimizing
  dependencies on other teams.
- The supergraph integrates these subgraphs into a single API, ensuring that the overall API remains consistent and
  cohesive.

This approach is ideal for large organizations where multiple teams work on distinct data domains but need to
collaborate through a unified API. For more information, check out
