# Project Configuration

## Introduction

With Hasura DDN, projects are configured completely via metadata. This makes it easy to author and update your API, as
well as collaborate with your team.

You can use the Hasura [DDN CLI](/cli/overview.mdx) to scaffold, author, validate and manage your metadata, and the
Hasura [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) to help you further
generate, auto-complete and validate your metadata.
