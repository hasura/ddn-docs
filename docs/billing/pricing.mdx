# Hasura DDN Plans and Pricing

## Overview

[Hasura DDN Pricing](https://hasura.io/pricing/v3) is designed for simplicity with fewer pricing components while
maintaining consistency across different plans and deployment methods. Additionally, this pricing model remains
independent of traffic, meaning that you won't incur higher costs as your traffic loads grow.

## Pricing units and terminology

| Pricing Unit      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model             | The number of models for billing purposes maps directly to the sum of [Model](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) and [Command](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) objects in the metadata. A model or a command can be created for a database table, view, microservice, API, etc. |
| Active Model      | An active model is defined as a model that is accessed more than 1000 times a month. A model is considered to be accessed if it is queried over the GraphQL API either directly or via a relationship                                                                            |
| Availability Zone | An Availability Zone is a redundant location within a data center where Hasura is running. These typically map to data center locations on major cloud providers.                                                                                                                |
| Data Transfer     | Amount of data in [Gibibytes](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte) (GiB) transferred across various channels while running a Hasura instance.                                                                                                                             |
