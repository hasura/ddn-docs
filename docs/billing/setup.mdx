# Hasura DDN Billing

## Overview

With Hasura DDN, you can setup billing in just a few steps. All you need to do is add a credit card to your plan and
you're off to the races!

## Add a payment method

You can manage the payment methods for your Hasura account by navigating to the
[billing section](https://console.hasura.io/billing "go to billing") of the console. You can access this via the menu in
the top-right of the projects page.
