# Hasura DDN Billing

## Overview
Hasura DDN Pricing is designed to be simple with fewer pricing components while maintaining consistency across different plans and deployment methods. 
Additionally, this pricing model remains independent of traffic usage, meaning that you won't incur higher costs as your traffic or usage grows.

### DDN Pricing Units and Terminology
|Pricing Unit |Details|
|---|--|
|Active Model|<ul><li> A model is either a logical grouping of data (model) or any piece of business logic (command) written and tracked in Hasura DDN. A model can be created from a database table, view, microservice, APIs, etc. If you are connecting to a REST API as a data source, then the output of the API is exposed as a model in Hasura DDN.</li> <li>An active model is defined as a model receiving >=1000 hits /month.</li> </ul>|
|Availability Zone|An AZ consists of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, and housed in separate facilities. It may be noteworthy that GCP uses a slightly different naming convention and refers to availability zones as “zones” within “regions.”|
|Data Transfer|DDN data transfer can occur in several manners depending on the cloud service provider hosting your Hasura deployment and the data sources. DDN calculates data transfer daily and is reported via usage reports within the Hasura dashboard.|


### DDN Plans
|DDN Plan|Details|
|---|---|
|DDN Free|<ul><li> Ideal for individual developers building and running a supergraph at any scale, and includes below</li> <li> Unlimited models, at any scale, </li> <li>1 supergraph developer, </li> <li> Observability: 15-minute retention </li> </ul>|
|DDN Base|<ul><li> Ideal for a single team building a business-critical supergraph, and includes below</li> <li> Unlimited supergraph developers, </li> <li> Observability: 30-day retention </li> </ul>|
|DDN Advanced|<ul><li> Ideal for multiple teams collaborating on a federated supergraph, and includes below</li> <li> Federated collaboration, </li> <li> Multi-repo CI/CD </li> </ul>|


### DDN Pricing
|DDN Plan| $ /Active Model /month| $ /Availability zone /month | $/GB of Data transfer|
|---|---|---|---|
|DDN Free| No charges | No charges| No charges|
|DDN Base| $5| <ul> <li> $0 on shared infra </li> <li>$1,000 for dedicated infra </li></ul>| <ul> <li> $0 on shared infra </li> <li> On actuals as charged to Hasura by cloud provider </li></ul>|
|DDN Advanced|$30| <ul> <li> $0 on shared infra </li> <li>$1,000 for dedicated infra </li></ul>|<ul> <li> $0 on shared infra </li> <li> On actuals as charged to Hasura by cloud provider </li></ul>|


### Hasura DDN on Dedicated infrastructure

For enhanced security, compliance and regulatory reasons, you can run Hasura on a dedicated infrastructure or as we call it Private DDN.

Your active-model prices will stay consistent with those in shared infrastructure. However, there will be a monthly charge of $1000 for each Availability Zone (AZ) where you have provisioned Hasura.


### Data Transfer
#### Sources of Data Transfer
DDN data transfer costs depend on the cloud service provider hosting your Hasura deployment and the data sources. DDN calculates data transfer daily and is reported via usage reports within the Hasura dashboard.


#### AWS
##### Traffic type:
1. Data transfer from internet to AWS 
2. Data transfer from AWS to internet
3. Data transfer between your workload and other AWS services
<ul><li> Accessing services within the same AWS Region </li>
<li>Accessing services across AWS Regions </li> </ul>
4. Data transfer within different components of your workload
<ul><li> Workload components in same AWS Region </li>
<li> Workload components in different AWS Regions </li> </ul>
5. Data transfer between AWS and on-premises data centers
<ul><li> Data transfer over AWS Site-to-Site VPN </li>
<li> Data transfer over AWS Direct Connect </li> </ul>

<ul> <li> https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/ </li>
<li> https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-of-data-transfer-costs-for-common-architectures/ </li> </ul>


#### GCP
##### Traffic type:

1. Inbound data transfer to GCP is free, however the compute for below resources is charged as part of data transfer
<ul> <li> Load balance </li>
<li> Cloud NAT </li>
<li> Protcol forwarding </li> </ul>
2. Data transfer to the same Google Cloud zone when using the internal IPv4 addresses or any IPv6 addresses
3. Data transfer to a different Google Cloud zone in the same Google Cloud region when using the internal or external IP addresses
4. VM-to-VM data transfer when the source and destination VMs are in different Google Cloud regions.
5. VM-to-Google service
<ul><li> Data transfer to specific Google products such as Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, DoubleClick, and Google Drive, whether from a VM in Google Cloud with an external IP address or an internal IP address. </li>
<li> Data transfer to a different Google Cloud service within the same region using an external IP address or an internal IP address, except for Memorystore for Redis, Filestore, GKE, and Cloud SQL. </li>
<li> Data transfer from Compute Engine and GKE to Cloud CDN and Media CDN. </li>
<li> Data transfer to Memorystore for Redis, Filestore, Cloud SQL, and Google Kubernetes Engine within the same region is priced the same as VM-to-VM traffic. </li>
<li>Data transfer to a Google Cloud service in a different region. </li>
<li> GCP to Internet data transfer</li> </ul>

#### Exceptions to Data Transfer Cost
Hasura doesn't charge for data transfer for customers who are on Hasura DDN plans on shared infrastructure and for customers who host Data plane in their own infrastructure (self-hosted Hasura).

### How to Reduce Data Transfer Cost
Considering data transfer charges while making architectural decisions can help save costs.
<ul>
<li> Avoid routing traffic over the internet </li> 
<li> Use data peering or VPC </li> 
<li> Traffic that crosses a Regional boundary will typically incur a data transfer charge. Avoid cross-Region data transfer unless your business case requires it </li> 
</ul>
