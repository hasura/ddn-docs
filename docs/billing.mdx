# Hasura DDN Billing

## Overview

[Hasura DDN Pricing](https://hasura.io/pricing/v3) is designed for simplicity with fewer pricing components while
maintaining consistency across different plans and deployment methods. Additionally, this pricing model remains
independent of traffic, meaning that you won't incur higher costs as your traffic loads grow.

## Pricing units and terminology

| Pricing Unit      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model             | The number of models for billing purposes maps directly to the sum of [Model](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) and [Command](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) objects in the metadata. A model or a command can be created for a database table, view, microservice, API, etc. |
| Active Model      | An active model is defined as a model that is accessed more than 1000 times a month. A model is considered to be accessed if it is queried over the GraphQL API either directly or via a relationship                                                                            |
| Availability Zone | An Availability Zone is a redundant location within a data center where Hasura is running. These typically map to data center locations on major cloud providers.                                                                                                                |
| Data Transfer     | Amount of data in [Gibibytes](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte) (GiB) transferred across various channels while running a Hasura instance.                                                                                                                             |

## Hasura DDN on dedicated infrastructure

For enhanced security, compliance and regulatory reasons, you can run Hasura on a dedicated infrastructure or as we call
it `Private DDN`.

Your active model prices will stay consistent with those in shared infrastructure. However, there will be a monthly
charge of $1000 for each Availability Zone (AZ) where you have provisioned Hasura.

## Data transfer

### Sources of data transfer

Data transfer costs depend on the cloud service provider hosting your Hasura deployment and the data sources.

### AWS

##### Traffic type

1. Data transfer from internet to AWS
2. Data transfer from AWS to internet
3. Data transfer between your workload and other AWS services
   - Accessing services within the same AWS Region
   - Accessing services across AWS Regions
4. Data transfer within different components of your workload
   - Workload components in same AWS Region
   - Workload components in different AWS Regions
5. Data transfer between AWS and on-premises data centers
   - Data transfer over AWS Site-to-Site VPN
   - Data transfer over AWS Direct Connect

More information about the current AWS data transfer prices can be found here:

- [AWS EC2 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/)
- [AWS blog post on data transfer costs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-of-data-transfer-costs-for-common-architectures/)

### GCP

#### Traffic type

1. Inbound data transfer to GCP is free, however the compute for below resources is charged as part of data transfer
   - Load balancing
   - Cloud NAT
   - Protocol forwarding
2. Data transfer to the same Google Cloud zone when using the internal IPv4 addresses or any IPv6 addresses
3. Data transfer to a different Google Cloud zone in the same Google Cloud region when using the internal or external IP
   addresses
4. VM-to-VM data transfer when the source and destination VMs are in different Google Cloud regions.
5. VM-to-Google service
   - Data transfer to specific Google products such as Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, DoubleClick, and Google Drive,
     whether from a VM in Google Cloud with an external IP address or an internal IP address.
   - Data transfer to a different Google Cloud service within the same region using an external IP address or an
     internal IP address, except for Memorystore for Redis, Filestore, GKE, and Cloud SQL.
   - Data transfer from Compute Engine and GKE to Cloud CDN and Media CDN.
   - Data transfer to Memorystore for Redis, Filestore, Cloud SQL, and Google Kubernetes Engine within the same region
     is priced the same as VM-to-VM traffic.
   - Data transfer to a Google Cloud service in a different region.
   - GCP to Internet data transfer

- [GCP network pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/network-pricing)

## Exceptions to Data Transfer Cost

Hasura doesn't charge for data transfer to customers who are on Hasura DDN plans on shared infrastructure and for
customers who host their data plane on their own infrastructure (self-hosted Hasura).

### How to reduce data transfer costs

Considering data transfer charges while making architectural decisions can help save costs.

- Avoid routing traffic over the internet.
- Use data peering or a VPC.
- Traffic that crosses a regional boundary will typically incur a data transfer charge. Avoid cross-region data transfer
  unless your use case requires it.
