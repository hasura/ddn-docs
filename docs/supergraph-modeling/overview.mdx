    <div>
      <p>
        Hasura believes the foundation for constructing your data supergraph should be in modeling it. Your API should
        be a reflection of your data, not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
        By focusing on modeling your data sources and business logic, you can create a robust data layer that is easy to
        understand and uses a declarative approach to define data models. This empowers you to create a data layer that
        is highly efficient and easy to maintain.
