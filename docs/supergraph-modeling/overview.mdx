<div>
  <p>
    Hasura believes the foundation for constructing your data supergraph should be in modeling it. Your API should be a
    reflection of your data, not the other way around.
  </p>
  <p>
    By focusing on modeling your data sources, you can create a robust data layer that is easy to understand and uses a
    declarative approach to define data models. This empowers you to create a data layer that is highly efficient and
    easy to maintain.
