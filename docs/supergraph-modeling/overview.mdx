# Supergraph Modeling

## Introduction

Hasura believes the foundation for constructing your data supergraph should be in modeling it. Your API should be a
reflection of your data, not the other way around.

By focusing on modeling your data sources and business logic, you can create a robust data layer that is easy to
understand and uses a declarative approach to define data models. This empowers you to create a data layer that is
highly efficient and easy to maintain.
