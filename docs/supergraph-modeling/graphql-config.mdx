# Configuration for GraphQL API

## Introduction

The `GraphqlConfig` object allows you to configure the GraphQL schema generated by Hasura. This object helps you
configure the common GraphQL schema applicable to all subgraphs within a project.

**The GraphqlConfig object belongs to the supergraph** and can be defined once across your supergraph in any subgraph of
your choice.

By default, all projects are created with a default `GraphqlConfig` object in the **globals** subgraph.

Specifically, it allows you to configure:

1. The root type names for query, mutation and subscription operations.
2. The name for Model selection input field names (`where`, `limit`, `offset`, `args`, `order_by`)
3. The enum values for `order_by` directions and the `order_by` enum type name.
