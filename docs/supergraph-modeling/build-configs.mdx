# Build configs

## Introduction

Build configs are used to define the configuration for building your **supergraph** or a **connector**. Written in YAML,
these configs are used to define the resources and other configurations required to build a supergraph or a
[connector](/connectors/overview.mdx).

It's helpful to think of build configs as a blueprint for building a supergraph or a connector.

### Supergraph config

The `Supergraph` object defines the configuration used to build the supergraph. While projects are generated with a
default config, you can add as many `Supergraph` objects as you need to define different configurations for building
your supergraph.

### Connector config

**Each** connector in your supergraph has its own config. The `Connector` object defines the configuration used to build
the connector. This allows you to configure the capabilities of the connector and tailor it to your needs.
