# Build configs

## Introduction

Build configs are used to define the resources and other configurations required to build a **supergraph**, **subgraph**
or a **connector**. They are written in YAML and are defined in individual files.

It's helpful to think of build configs as a blueprint for building your supergraph. The following options are available
to you:

| Config type               | Description                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| [Supergraph](#supergraph) | Defines the configuration used to build a supergraph. |
| [Subgraph](#subgraph)     | Defines the configuration used to build a subgraph.   |
| [Connector](#connector)   | Defines the configuration used to build a connector.  |

### How the Supergraph config works {#supergraph}

#### Lifecycle

The [Supergraph](#supergraph-supergraph) object defines the configuration used to build the supergraph. While projects
are generated with default configs for building for local or Hasura DDN
[when initializing a new supergraph](/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_init.mdx), you can add as many `Supergraph` objects as
you need to define different configurations for building your supergraph.

You can then use these files to build your supergraph — either locally or on Hasura DDN —
[using the CLI](/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_local.mdx). These builds — when on Hasura DDN — can then be
[applied to a project](/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_apply.mdx) which will then serve the API using the supergraph
built from the configuration.

#### Examples

```yaml title="A supergraph.yaml config file:"
kind: Supergraph
version: v2
definition:
  subgraphs:
    - globals/subgraph.yaml
    - app/subgraph.yaml
```

| **Field**              | **Description**                                                                      | **Reference**                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kind`                 | Specifies the type of configuration, in this case, `Supergraph`.                     | [Supergraph](#supergraph-supergraph)                         |
| `version`              | The version of the `Supergraph` configuration, which is `v2`.                        | [Supergraph](#supergraph-supergraph)                         |
| `definition.subgraphs` | Paths to the subgraph configuration files that are included in the supergraph build. | [SupergraphDefinitionV2](#supergraph-supergraphdefinitionv2) |

### How the Subgraph config works {#subgraph}

#### Lifecycle

**Each** subgraph in your supergraph has its own config. The [Subgraph](#subgraph-subgraph) object defines the
configuration used to build the subgraph. While subgraphs are generated with a default config
[when initializing a new subgraph](/cli/commands/ddn_subgraph_init.mdx), you can add as many `Subgraph` objects as you
need to define different configurations for building a subgraph.

You can then use these files to build a subgraph [using the CLI](/cli/commands/ddn_subgraph_build_create.mdx). These
subgraph builds can then be [applied to a project](/cli/commands/ddn_subgraph_build_apply.mdx).

#### Examples

```yaml title="A supergraph.yaml config file:"
kind: Subgraph
version: v2
definition:
  name: app
  generator:
    rootPath: .
  includePaths:
    - metadata
  envMapping:
    APP_MY_CONNECTOR_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER:
      fromEnv: APP_MY_CONNECTOR_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER
    APP_MY_CONNECTOR_READ_URL:
      fromEnv: APP_MY_CONNECTOR_READ_URL
    APP_MY_CONNECTOR_WRITE_URL:
      fromEnv: APP_MY_CONNECTOR_WRITE_URL
  connectors:
    - path: connector/my_connector/connector.yaml
      connectorLinkName: my_connector
```

| `kind`                                    | Specifies the type of configuration, in this case, `Subgraph`.                                                                                                                                                                                           | [Subgraph](#subgraph-subgraph)                               |

| `definition.envMapping`                   | Environment variable mapping configuration.

### How the Connector config works {#connector}

#### Lifecycle

**Each** [data connector](/connectors/overview.mdx) in your supergraph has its own config. The
[Connector](#connector-connector) object defines the configuration used to build the connector. This allows you to
configure the capabilities of the connector and tailor it to your needs. While connectors are initialized with default
configs for building for local or Hasura DDN, you can add as many `Connector` objects as you need to define different
configurations for building your connector.

When you [initialize a connector](/cli/commands/ddn_connector_init.mdx), the CLI will automatically create a connector
config file for you. You can then use this file to build your connector
[using the CLI](/cli/commands/ddn_connector_build_create.mdx).

#### Examples

```yaml title="A connector.yaml config file:"
kind: Connector
version: v2
definition:
  name: MY_CONNECTOR
  subgraph: app
  source: hasura/postgres:v1.1.1
  context: .
  envMapping:
    CONNECTION_URI:
      fromEnv: APP_MY_CONNECTOR_CONNECTION_URI
    HASURA_SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET:
      fromEnv: APP_MY_CONNECTOR_HASURA_SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT:
      fromEnv: APP_MY_CONNECTOR_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT
    OTEL_SERVICE_NAME:
      fromEnv: APP_MY_CONNECTOR_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
```
