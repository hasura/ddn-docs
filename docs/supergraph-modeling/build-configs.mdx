# Build configs

## Introduction

Build configs are used to define the resources and other configurations required to build a **supergraph**, **subgraph**
or a **connector**. They are written in YAML and are defined in individual files.

It's helpful to think of build configs as a blueprint for building your supergraph.

### Supergraph config {#supergraph-config}

The [Supergraph](#supergraph-supergraph) object defines the configuration used to build the supergraph. While projects
are generated with default configs for building for local or Hasura DDN, you can add as many `Supergraph` objects as you
need to define different configurations for building your supergraph.

### Subgraph config {#subgraph-config}

**Each** subgraph in your supergraph has its own config. The [Subgraph](#subgraph-subgraph) object defines the
configuration used to build the subgraph. While subgraphs are generated with a default config, you can add as many
`Subgraph` objects as you need to define different configurations for building your subgraph.

### Connector config {#connector-config}

**Each** [data connector](/connectors/overview.mdx) in your supergraph has its own config. The
[Connector](#connector-connector) object defines the configuration used to build the connector. This allows you to
configure the capabilities of the connector and tailor it to your needs. While connectors are initialized with default
configs for building for local or Hasura DDN, you can add as many `Connector` objects as you need to define different
configurations for building your connector.
