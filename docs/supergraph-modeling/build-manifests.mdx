# Build Manifests

## Introduction

Build manifests are used to define the configuration for building your **supergraph** or a **connector**. Written in
YAML, these manifests are used to define the resources and other configurations required to build a supergraph or a
[connector](/connectors/overview.mdx).

It's helpful to think of build manifests as a blueprint for building a supergraph or a connector.

### Supergraph manifests

The supergraph manifest defines the configuration used to build the supergraph. While projects are generated with a
default manifest, you can add as many SupergraphManifests as you need to define different configurations for building
your supergraph.

### Connector manifests

**Each** connector in your supergraph has its own manifest. The ConnectorManifest defines the configuration used to
build the connector. This allows you to configure the capabilities of the connector and tailor it to your needs.

:::info Use the CLI to generate manifests

A connector manifest can easily be generated using the CLI's [`add connector-manifest` command](#).
