# Compatibility Config

## Introduction

The CompatibilityConfig object is a metadata object that defines the compatibility configuration of the Hasura metadata.

## How CompatibilityConfig works

### Lifecycle

By default, all projects are created with a default CompatibilityConfig object in the **globals** subgraph. It can be
defined in any subgraph of your choice, but only once across your supergraph.

The `date` field in the CompatibilityConfig object specifies the date after which any new backwards-incompatible changes
made to Hasura DDN will be disabled and will not impact the Hasura project. For example, if your project has its `date`
set to `2024-10-16`, then any new features added after that date that would result in breaking changes to your project
will be disabled. To enable these features, simply increase your `date` to a newer date.

### Compatibility dates and breaking changes

The following is a list of dates at which backwards-incompatible changes were added to Hasura DDN. Projects with
CompatibilityConfig `date`s prior to these dates will have these features disabled.

#### 2024-11-15

##### Require a valid NDC version in data connector capabilities

A build error is now raised when there is an invalid version in the capabilities of a data connector's schema. To fix
the error, please consider upgrading to the latest version of the data connector and running `ddn connector introspect`
to correct the invalid version. Prior to this change, it was assumed that the data connector with the invalid version
was an NDC v0.1.x connector.

#### 2024-10-31

##### Disallow comparisons against scalar array fields in predicates

A build error is now raised if a scalar array field is configured in a BooleanExpressionType as a comparable field.
Comparisons against scalar array fields are not supported as at this compatibility date.

#### 2024-10-16

##### Enable JSON session variable support

Session variables provided in JWT claims, webhook responses or in the NoAuth settings can now be any JSON value, instead
of just a string. This enable scenarios such as being able to put lists of values into a single session variable.
However, this now means that if you use the session variable in a comparison against a field, the field's type must
match the type of the session variable. For example, if you are comparing against an integer field, your session
variable must be set as a JSON number and not a string.

#### 2024-10-07

##### Require unique command GraphQL names

A build error is now raised when there is a conflict with a GraphQL root field or GraphQL type name that is already in
use. Before this, the command would be silently dropped from the GraphQL schema.

#### 2024-09-26

##### Propagate boolean expression deprecation status

The `deprecated` status for relationship fields is now propagated to boolean expressions that use them. The default
GraphQL introspection behavior is to hide such fields from the schema, so this behavior is considered a breaking change.

##### Disallow scalar types names conflicting with inbuilt types

A build error is now raised when a `ScalarType` metadata type is defined that conflicts with any of the built-in type
names (`ID`, `Int`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Float`).

#### 2024-09-18

##### Require nested array filtering capability

A build error is now raised when a nested array field is defined on an ObjectType used in a Model whose underlying data
connector does not have the `query.exists.nested_collections` capability defined.

#### 2024-09-03

##### Enable relationships in predicates to be used even if the data connector does not support it

Previously, only data connectors that supported the `relationships.relation_comparisons` capability supported
relationships in predicates. This change allows you to use relationships in boolean expressions even if the data
connector lacks support. When the capability is available, relationship predicates are resolved directly within the
native data connector for more efficient processing. If not, the predicates are handled at the API layer.

#### 2024-06-30

##### Require GraphQL Config

A build error is now raised if a [GraphQLConfig](supergraph-modeling/graphql-config.mdx) is not provided in the project
metadata.

## Metadata structure

### v2_CompatibilityConfig {#v2_compatibilityconfig-v2_compatibilityconfig}

The compatibility configuration of the Hasura metadata.

| Key    | Value                 | Required | Description                                                                                      |

| `date` | string                | true     | Any backwards incompatible changes made to Hasura DDN after this date won't impact the metadata. |
