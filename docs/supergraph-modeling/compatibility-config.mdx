# Compatibility Config

## Introduction

The CompatibilityConfig object is a metadata object that defines the compatibility configuration of the Hasura metadata.
The `date` field in the `CompatibilityConfig` object specifies the date after which any backwards incompatible changes
made to Hasura DDN won't impact the metadata.

As this relates to the entire supergraph of a Hasura project, the `CompatibilityConfig` object lives in the
`/supergraph` subdirectory of your project.
