# Relationships

## Introduction

A relationship allows you to query nested or linked information. This allows you to extend [type](./types.mdx) objects
with related [models](./models.mdx) or related [commands](./commands.mdx).

Typically, relationships will can take one of two forms:

| Type of relationship | Description                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Model-to-model       | A relationship between two models, allowing you to query related data from one model to another. |
| Model-to-command     | A relationship between a model and a command, allowing you to query related data from a command. |

The former is the most common relationship type, allowing you to query related data from one model to another. This
enables you to create nested queries, allowing you to fetch related data in a single query.

The latter is a more advanced relationship type, allowing you to query related data from a command. This is useful when
you want to query data from a command that is not directly related to a model and even return the data in a nested
format. You can imagine enriching or transforming data from a command and returning it as part of a nested query,
thereby saving the need for multiple queries or data transformations in your application.

:::info LSP-assisted authoring

Relationships are written in your various HML files. If you're using a compatible editor (such as VS Code with the
[Hasura extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura)), LSP-assisted authoring will
help you create relationships more efficiently. LSP will provide you with auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and
error checking as you write your relationships.

Using this feature, you can even execute the `track all` command in VS Code's command palette to automatically track all
foreign-key relationships in your project ðŸŽ‰
