# Relationships

## Introduction

A relationship allows you to query nested or linked information, for example from `Manufacturers` to `Products`. A
relationship allows you extend [type](./types.mdx) objects with related [models](./models.mdx) or related
[commands](./commands.mdx).

To create a relationship, you will need to define an object with `kind: Relationship` and `version: v1`. The object
`definition` has a `name`, the `source` type, a `target` model and the `mapping` between the two.

### Metadata structure

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  source: <String>
  name: <String>
  target: <TargetModelConfiguration> | <TargetCommandConfiguration>
  mapping: <RelationshipMapping>
```

## Example

### Basic model relationship

Let's add the following relationships to the above types.

1. `Array` relationship where `author` has many `Articles`:

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version:
definition:
  source: author
  name: articles
  target:
    model:
      name: Articles
      relationshipType: Array
  mappings:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: id
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: author_id
```

2. `Object` relationship where `article` has one `Author`:

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  source: article
  name: author
  target:
    model:
      name: Authors
      relationshipType: Object
  mappings:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: author_id
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: id
```

The resulting GraphQL schema will appear as:

```graphql
type Authors {
  author_id: Int!
  first_name: String!
  last_name: String!
  articles: [Article!]!
}

type Articles {
  id: Int!
  author_id: Int!
  title: String!
  author: Author
}
```

### Basic command relationship

Let's add the following relationships to the above types.

1. Relationship to retrieve the `Author` of an `Article` (here the command `get_author` takes in the `author_id` of the
   author and returns the `AuthorFromCommand`):

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  source: article
  name: author
  target:
    command:
      name: get_author
  mappings:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: author_id
      target:
        argument:
          - argumentName: id
```

2. Relationship to retrieve the `Articles` of an `Author` (here the command `get_articles` takes in the `id` of the
   author and returns an array of `ArticleFromCommand`):

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  source: author
  name: articles
  target:
    command:
      name: get_articles
  mappings:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: id
      target:
        argument:
          - argumentName: id
```

The resulting GraphQL schema will appear as:

```graphql
type Authors {
  author_id: Int!
  first_name: String!
  last_name: String!
  articles: [ArticleFromCommand!]!
}

type Articles {
  id: Int!
  author_id: Int!
  title: String!
  author: AuthorFromCommand!
}
```

### Relationship across subgraphs

Now, imagine if the `Article` model is defined in a **different subgraph** called `subgraph_articles` and the `Author`
type and the following array relationship are part of the `default` subgraph.

We will now need to specify the **target** subgraph in the `target` section of the relationship definition as
`subgraph: subgraph_articles` as shown below:

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version:
definition:
  source: author
  name: articles
  target:
    model:
      name: Articles
      relationshipType: Array
      subgraph: subgraph_articles
  mappings:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: id
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: author_id
```

Next, imagine you want to query the author from the `Article` model, which is specified in the `subgraph_articles`
subgraph. You will need to specify where the `Authors` can be queried from by specifying the **subgraph** in the
`target` section of the relationship.

In this case, by specifying the subgraph as `subgraph: default` as shown below:

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  source: article
  name: author
  target:
    model:
      name: Authors
      relationshipType: Object
      subgraph: default
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: author_id
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: id
```

:::info Local and Remote Relationships

Syntactically, there are no differences between local (e.g., a relationship between two columns in the same datasource,
or an existing foreign-key relationship) or remote (a relationship across two different data sources) relationships.
Hasura DDN will automatically detect the type of relationship and make the optimal query plan accordingly.

:::

:::info Current limitations

1. Only types to top-level model/command types relationships are supported.
2. Simple top-level type field to top-level model field/command argument mapping are supported.
3. Only type to function based commands are supported. :::
