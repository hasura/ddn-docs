# Aggregate Expressions

## Introduction

Aggregate expression types allow you to summarize and calculate collective properties of your data. These expressions
enable you to define how to aggregate over different data types, facilitating efficient data manipulation and retrieval.

Aggregate expressions can be used to configure how data is summarized in your models, or as the types of arguments to
commands or models.
