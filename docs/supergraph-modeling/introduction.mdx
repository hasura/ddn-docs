# Introduction

Hasura v3 introduces the concept of the data supergraph.

Your supergraph metadata defines the data models for each subgraph, including the types of the data objects, models and
commands used to interact with the data, and access control rules on this data. This data model is then combined with
Native Data Connector agents, which are services to communicate with the raw data sources (like a database) in order to
server your API.

## How is this different from Hasura v2 metadata?

- Hasura V2 metadata was specifically designed for Hasura, whereas Hasura v3 utilizes the
  [OpenDD spec](https://github.com/hasura/open-data-domain-specification), which is a general specification for modeling
  a data supergraph usable by anyone.
- Functionally, the V2 metadata relied directly on the raw data source for information like columns and fields, whereas
  supergraph metadata is independent of the data source. All fields and types are explicitly defined within the metadata
  itself which eliminates the necessity for data source schema introspection at startup to generate a GraphQL schema.
  Also, the v3 metadata is still semantically consistent even if the underlying data source has changed.
- Compared to the v2 metadata, there is a lot more flexibility offered when configuring your GraphQL API.

## Supergraph Configuration

The supergraph configuration is an array of one of the following metadata objects:

```yaml
objects:
  - kind: CompatibilityConfig
    # ... (other properties for CompatibilityConfig)
  - kind: AuthConfig
    # ... (other properties for AuthConfig)
```

More details about these can be found [here](/ci-cd/config.mdx#supergraph).

## Subgraph Configuration

There can be any number of subgraphs in your supergraph. Each subgraph has a name and a configuration consisting of an
array of the following metadata objects:

```yaml
name: my_subgraph
objects:
  - kind: HasuraHubDataConnector
    # ... (other properties for HasuraHubDataConnector)
  - kind: DataConnector
    # ... (other properties for DataConnector)
  - kind: ScalarType
    # ... (other properties for ScalarType)
  - kind: ObjectType
    # ... (other properties for ObjectType)
  - kind: DataConnectorScalarRepresentation
    # ... (other properties for DataConnectorScalarRepresentation)
  - kind: Model
    # ... (other properties for Model)
  - kind: Command
    # ... (other properties for Command)
  - kind: Relationship
    # ... (other properties for Relationship)
  - kind: TypePermissions
    # ... (other properties for TypePermissions)
  - kind: ModelPermissions
    # ... (other properties for ModelPermissions)
  - kind: CommandPermissions
    # ... (other properties for CommandPermissions)
```

## Data Connectors

The [data connector](./data-connectors.mdx) will define where the data is coming from. It can be a database, a REST API,
a GraphQL API, etc. The data connector will use the [Native Data Connector](/connectors/overview.mdx) protocol to
connect to the data source and fetch the data.

### The DataConnector object

The [`DataConnector`](./data-connectors.mdx) object describes a physical data connector that is hosted at a URL that
Hasura can talk to for serving queries. These data connectors are self-deployed and managed outside of the Hasura
metadata.

### The HasuraHubDataConnector object {#hasura-hub-data-connector}

The [`HasuraHubDataConnector`](./data-connectors.mdx#hasura-hub-data-connector) object allows you to atomically
configure and deploy a data connector available in the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors/) directly from the
metadata.

## Types

[Types](./types.mdx) are a fundamental building block of supergraph metadata with every bit of data having a type.

### The ObjectType object

The [`ObjectType`](./types.mdx#object-types) object allows you to create structured object types with fields.

### The ScalarType object

The [`ScalarType`](./types.mdx#scalar-types) object allows you to create opaque types whose semantics are unknown to
your supergraph.

### The DataConnectorScalarRepresentation object

The [`DataConnectorScalarRepresentation`](./types.mdx#scalar-type-representation) object allows you to define how a
scalar type from a data connector (eg: varchar from postgres) is represented in your data graph.

## Models

[Models](./models.mdx) are the link between your data sources and the API Hasura generates. A model may be backed by a
database table, an ad-hoc SQL query, a pre-materialized view, a custom REST or GraphQL API server, etc.

### The Model object

The [`Model`](./models.mdx) object represents a collection of data objects (like rows in a SQL table or documents in
collection in a NoSQL database) of a certain [type](./types.mdx). A Model object also defines how the model and its
types or fields map to entities in the underlying data source. It also defines how it is represented in the GraphQL API.

## Commands

[Commands](./commands.mdx) are the other way of accessing data within your supergraph. Commands are functions /
procedures whose implementations are unknown to your supergraph except for their input arguments and output type.

### The Command object

The [Command](./commands.mdx) object defines the name of the command, the arguments to the command and the output type
of the command. It also defines any mappings of arguments / types from your supergraph to their corresponding NDC
versions.

## Relationships

[Relationships](./relationships.mdx) allow you extend [object types](./types.mdx) with related [models](./models.mdx)
which then allows you to query nested or linked information.

### The Relationship object

The [`Relationship`](./relationships.mdx) object defines a relationship between a source [type](./types.mdx) and a
target [models](./models.mdx).

## Permissions

You can define [permissions](./permissions.mdx), (also known as access control or authorization rules) on
[types](./types.mdx), [models](./models.mdx) and [commands](./commands.mdx).

### The TypePermissions object

[`TypePermissions`](./permissions.mdx#type-permissions) define which fields are allowed to be accessed by a role.

### The ModelPermissions object

[`ModelPermissions`](./permissions.mdx#model-permissions) define which objects or rows within the model are allowed to
be accessed by a role.

### The CommandPermissions object

[`CommandPermissions`](./permissions.mdx#command-permissions) define which commands are allowed to be executed by a
role.

## Automatic metadata generation

The new Hasura DDN tooling of Console and the
[VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) have built-in capabilities to
autogenerate metadata from your existing data via the GUI console or CLI terminal commands. Alternatively, you can also
author metadata manually.
