# Types

## Introduction

Types serve as the fundamental elements that define the structure of your data.

Being able to define types in your data domain is beneficial because it provides you with the flexibility to define them
separately from the types in your data connector.

The specification employs a concrete type system that includes both primitive types and user-defined types. All
subsequent layers, such as models, commands, and relationships are defined in terms of these types.

The types can be one of the following:

| Type            | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primitive       | These are the basic types `ID`, `Int`, `Float`, `Boolean`, or `String`                                   |
| Custom          | These are user-defined types, such as [`ScalarType`](#scalar-types) or [`ObjectType`](#object-types)     |
| Type References | When specifying the types of a field or an argument, you can mark them as required `!` or repeated `[]`. |

The spec also allows you to map existing data connector scalars to types in your data domain.

You can also define custom types by either aliasing existing types (such as primitives or custom), or you can define a
type with fields. In turn, the fields themselves can be a primitive or another custom type.

Type references are types of fields and arguments that refer to other primitive or custom types and which can be marked
as nullable, required or repeated (in the case of arrays).

[//]: # "TODO: Add reference to scalars ðŸ‘‡ when data connector are documented"

[Scalar type representation](#scalar-type-representation) helps in mapping data connector scalars to any of the above
types.

## Primitive types and type references {#primitive-types-and-type-references}

Primitive types supported are `ID`, `Int`, `Float`, `Boolean` and `String`.

Type references follow [GraphQL type syntax](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Combining-List-and-Non-Null). Fields
and arguments are nullable by default. To represent non-nullability, specify a `!` after the type name. Similarly, array
fields and arguments are wrapped in `[]`.

### Examples

If the field is nullable, it should be defined as

```yaml
name: category
type: ProductCategory
```

If the field is non-nullable, it should be defined as

```yaml
name: category
type: ProductCategory!
```

If the field is a nullable array of nullable type, it should be defined as

```yaml
name: tags
type: [String]
```

If the field is a nullable array of non-nullable type, it should be defined as

```yaml
name: tags
type: [String!]
```

If the field is a non-nullable array of nullable type, it should be defined as

```yaml
name: tags
type:
  [String]!
```

If the field is a non-nullable array of non-nullable type, it should be defined as

```yaml
name: tags
type:
  [String!]!
```

## Metadata structure

### ObjectType

Definition of a user-defined Open DD object type.

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | object | true | The name to give this object type, used to refer to it elsewhere in the metadata. Must be unique across all types defined in this subgraph. |
| `fields` | array | true | The list of fields defined for this object type. |
| `globalIdFields` | array,null | false | The subset of fields that uniquely identify this object in the domain. Setting this property will automatically implement the GraphQL Relay Node interface for this object type and add an `id` global ID field. If setting this property, there must not be a field named `id` already present. |
| `graphql` | object | false | Configuration for how this object type should appear in the GraphQL schema. |
| `description` | string,null | false | The description of the object. Gets added to the description of the object's definition in the graphql schema. |

Example:

```yaml
name: Author
fields:
  - name: author_id
    type: Int!
    description: The id of the author
  - name: first_name
    type: String
    description: The first name of the author
  - name: last_name
    type: String
    description: The last name of the author
globalIdFields:
  - author_id
graphql:
  typeName: Author
  inputTypeName: null
description: An author of a book

```

#### ObjectFieldDefinition

The definition of a field in a user-defined object type.

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | object | true | The name of the field. This name is used both when referring to the field elsewhere in the metadata and when creating the corresponding GraphQl type. |
| `type` | object | true | The type of this field. This uses the GraphQL syntax to represent field types and must refer to one of the inbuilt OpenDd types or another user-defined type. |
| `description` | string,null | false | The description of this field. Gets added to the description of the field's definition in the graphql schema. |

#### ObjectTypeGraphQLConfiguration

GraphQL configuration of an Open DD object type.

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `typeName` | object | false | The name to use for the GraphQL type representation of this object type when used in an output context. |
| `inputTypeName` | object | false | The name to use for the GraphQL type representation of this object type when used in an input context. |

### ScalarType

Definition of a user-defined scalar type that that has opaque semantics.

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | object | true | The name to give this scalar type, used to refer to it elsewhere in the metadata. Must be unique across all types defined in this subgraph. |
| `graphql` | object | false | Configuration for how this scalar type should appear in the GraphQL schema. |
| `description` | string,null | false | The description of this scalar. Gets added to the description of the scalar's definition in the graphql schema. |

Example:

```yaml
name: CustomString
graphql:
  typeName: CustomString
description: A custom string type

```

#### ScalarTypeGraphQLConfiguration

GraphQL configuration of an Open DD scalar type

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `typeName` | object | true | The name of the GraphQl type to use for this scalar. |
