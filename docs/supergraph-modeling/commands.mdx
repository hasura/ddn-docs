# Commands

## Introduction

Commands are backed by **functions** or **procedures** declared in a `DataConnector` allowing you to execute business
logic directly from your GraphQL API. You can use them to validate, process, or enrich some data, call another API, or
log a user in. As an example, with commands you can connect to a REST endpoint which can be your own custom server, a
public API, or a serverless function.

### Functions

Functions are used for **read** operations. They will not modify the data in the database. They can only be used to
retrieve data.

### Procedures

Procedures are used for **write** operations. They can modify the data in the database. They can be used to create,
update, or delete data.

:::info Using commands in relationships

As relationships are a querying construct, **only functions** can be used in relationships.

## Metadata structure

### Command

The definition of a command. A command is a user-defined operation which can take arguments and returns an output. The semantics of a command are opaque to the Open DD specification.

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | `string` | `true` | The name of the command. |
| `outputType` | [`TypeReference`](#typereference) | `true` | The return type of the command. |
| `arguments` | [`ArgumentDefinition`](#argumentdefinition) | `false` | The list of arguments accepted by this command. Defaults to no arguments. |
| `source` | [`CommandSource`](#commandsource) | `false` | The source configuration for this command. |
| `graphql` | [`CommandGraphQlDefinition`](#commandgraphqldefinition) | `false` | Configuration for how this command should appear in the GraphQL schema. |
| `description` | `string,null` | `false` | The description of the command. Gets added to the description of the command's root field in the graphql schema. |



**Example:**

```yaml
name: get_latest_article
outputType: commandArticle
arguments: []
source:
  dataConnectorName: data_connector
  dataConnectorCommand:
    function: latest_article
  typeMapping:
    commandArticle:
      fieldMapping:
        article_id:
          column: id
  argumentMapping: {}
graphql:
  rootFieldName: getLatestArticle
  rootFieldKind: Query
description: Get the latest article

```

#### ArgumentDefinition

The definition of an argument for a field, command, or model.

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name` | `string` | `true` |  |
| `type` | `string` | `true` | A reference to an Open DD type including nullable values and arrays. Suffix '!' to indicate a non-nullable reference, and wrap in '[]' to indicate an array. Eg: '[String!]!' is a non-nullable array of non-nullable strings. |
| `description` | `string,null` | `false` |  |

#### CommandSource

Description of how a command maps to a particular data connector

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `dataConnectorName` | `string` | `true` | The name of the data connector backing this command. |
| `dataConnectorCommand` | [`DataConnectorCommand`](#dataconnectorcommand) | `true` | The function/procedure in the data connector that backs this command. |
| `typeMapping` | [`TypeMapping`](#typemapping) | `false` | How the various types used in this command correspond to entities in the data connector. |
| `argumentMapping` | `object` | `false` | Mapping from command argument names to data connector table argument names. |



**Example:**

```yaml
dataConnectorName: data_connector
dataConnectorCommand:
  function: latest_article
typeMapping: {}
argumentMapping: {}

```

#### DataConnectorCommand

#### Function

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `function` | `string` | `true` | The name of a function backing the command. |

#### Procedure

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `procedure` | `string` | `true` | The name of a procedure backing the command. |

#### CommandGraphQlDefinition

The definition of how a command should appear in the GraphQL API.

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `rootFieldName` | `string` | `true` | The name of the graphql root field to use for this command. |
| `rootFieldKind` | [`GraphQlRootFieldKind`](#graphqlrootfieldkind) | `true` | Whether to put this command in the Query or Mutation root of the GraphQL API. |



**Example:**

```yaml
rootFieldName: getLatestArticle
rootFieldKind: Query

```
