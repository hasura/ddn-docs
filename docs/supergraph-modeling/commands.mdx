# Commands

## Introduction

A "Command" in Hasura DDN represents an action that can be performed to returning some type of result (eg: `LogUserIn`).
Very loosely, you can think of commands as the verbs or, "actions" of your data domain.

Commands have a fixed definition and are backed by **functions** or **procedures**, allowing you to add top level
methods to your API, or, add a custom field to an existing [model](./models.mdx).

Commands allow you to execute business logic directly from your GraphQL API and are useful in validating, processing or
enriching data, calling another API, or, for example, logging a user in.

Once a command is declared it will then often be referenced by `Relationship` objects in order to compose them with each
other or models, and also by `Permissions` objects to control access to the command execution.

A function in TypeScript with the [Node.js Lambda connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-nodejs-lambda):

```typescript
/**
 * @readonly Exposes the function as an NDC function (the function should only query data without making modifications)
 */
export function hello(name?: string) {
  return `hello ${name ?? "world"}`;
}
```

It would be represented in our metadata as the following command:

```yaml
---
kind: Command
version: v1
definition:
  name: Hello
  outputType: String!
  arguments:
    - name: name
      type: String
  source:
    dataConnectorName: my_data_connector
    dataConnectorCommand:
      function: hello
  graphql:
    rootFieldName: hello
    rootFieldKind: Query
```

And then queried in the API like so:

```graphql
query {
  hello(name: "Hasura")
}
```

</details>

### Functions vs. Procedures

Functions are used for **read** operations. They will not modify the data in the database. They can only be used to
retrieve data. As relationships are a querying construct, **only functions** can be used in relationships.

Procedures are used for **write** operations. They can modify the data in the database. They can be used to create,
update, or delete data.
