# Commands

## Introduction

Commands are backed by **functions** or **procedures** declared in a `DataConnector` allowing you to execute business
logic directly from your GraphQL API. You can use them to validate, process, or enrich some data, call another API, or
log a user in. As an example, with commands you can connect to a REST endpoint which can be your own custom server, a
public API, or a serverless function.

### Functions

Functions are used for **read** operations. They will not modify the data in the database. They can only be used to
retrieve data.

### Procedures

Procedures are used for **write** operations. They can modify the data in the database. They can be used to create,
update, or delete data.

:::info Using commands in relationships

As relationships are a querying construct, **only functions** can be used in relationships.

## Metadata structure


### Command

The definition of a command. A command is a user-defined operation which can take arguments and returns an output. The semantics of a command are opaque to the Open DD specification.

| Key | Schema | Required | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| `kind` | `Command` | true |  |
| `version` | `v1` | true |  |
| `definition` | [CommandV1](#commandv1) | true |  |



#### CommandV1

Definition of an OpenDD Command, which is a custom operation that can take arguments and returns an output. The semantics of a command are opaque to OpenDD.

| Key | Schema | Required | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| `name` | string | true | The name of the command. |
| `outputType` | string | true | The return type of the command. |
| `arguments` | [[ArgumentDefinition](#argumentdefinition)] | false | The list of arguments accepted by this command. Defaults to no arguments. |
| `source` | [CommandSource](#commandsource) / null | false | The source configuration for this command. |
| `graphql` | [CommandGraphQlDefinition](#commandgraphqldefinition) / null | false | Configuration for how this command should appear in the GraphQL schema. |
| `description` | string | false | The description of the command. Gets added to the description of the command's root field in the graphql schema. |

 **Example:**

```yaml
name: get_latest_article
outputType: commandArticle
arguments: []
source:
  dataConnectorName: data_connector
  dataConnectorCommand:
    function: latest_article
  argumentMapping: {}
graphql:
  rootFieldName: getLatestArticle
  rootFieldKind: Query
description: Get the latest article
```


#### CommandGraphQlDefinition

The definition of how a command should appear in the GraphQL API.

| Key | Schema | Required | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| `rootFieldName` | string | true | The name of the graphql root field to use for this command. |
| `rootFieldKind` | `Query` / `Mutation` | true | Whether to put this command in the Query or Mutation root of the GraphQL API. |
| `deprecated` | [Deprecated](#deprecated) / null | false | Whether this command root field is deprecated. If set, this will be added to the graphql schema as a deprecated field. |

 **Example:**

```yaml
rootFieldName: getLatestArticle
rootFieldKind: Query
```


#### CommandSource

Description of how a command maps to a particular data connector

| Key | Schema | Required | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| `dataConnectorName` | string | true | The name of the data connector backing this command. |
| `dataConnectorCommand` | [DataConnectorCommand](#dataconnectorcommand) | true | The function/procedure in the data connector that backs this command. |
| `argumentMapping` | [undefined](#undefined) | false | Mapping from command argument names to data connector table argument names. |

 **Example:**

```yaml
dataConnectorName: data_connector
dataConnectorCommand:
  function: latest_article
argumentMapping: {}
```


#### undefined

Mapping from command argument names to data connector table argument names.

| Key | Schema | Required | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| `<customKey>` | string | false |  |



#### DataConnectorCommand

The function/procedure in the data connector that backs this command.


**Must have exactly one of the following fields:**

| Key | Schema | Required | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| `function` | string | false |  |
| `procedure` | string | false |  |
