# Commands

## Introduction

In Hasura DDN, a **command** represents an action that can be executed within your data domain. Commands act as the
verbs or operations that modify or interact with the data managed by your [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx).
They can be triggered via GraphQL queries or mutations.

Commands have a fixed definition and are backed by [functions](#command-functionname) (exposed as queries) or
[procedures](#command-procedurename) (exposed as mutations) allowing you to add top-level methods to your API, or, add a
custom field to an existing model.

Commands also allow you to execute [custom business logic](/business-logic/overview.mdx) directly from your GraphQL API
and are useful in validating, processing or enriching data, calling another API, or, for example, logging a user in.

## How commands work

### Lifecycle

Commands can be added to your metadata [using the CLI](/cli/commands/ddn_command_add.mdx). The CLI will use a
connector's [DataConnectorLink object](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx) to determine which functions or
procedures are available to be added as commands.

You should [update your commands](/cli/commands/ddn_command_update.mdx) whenever you make changes to your data sources
and, in turn, your DataConnectorLink objects. This ensures that your API remains in sync with your data.

As an example, if you're usings the [TypesScript connector](/business-logic/typescript.mdx) for business logic and add a
new function, you'll need to update your DataConnectorLink to ensure that the new function is present in the connector's
configuration. Then, add the new command to your metadata.

To make a new command available in your supergraph, you'll need to
[create a new build](/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_local.mdx) using the CLI.

### Examples

## Metadata structure


### Command {#command-command}

The definition of a command. A command is a user-defined operation which can take arguments and returns an output. The semantics of a command are opaque to the Open DD specification.
