# AuthConfig

## Introduction

The `AuthConfig` object is used to define the authentication configuration used by the API. With Hasura, you can utilize
either webhooks or JWTs for authentication.

**The AuthConfig object belongs to the supergraph** and can be defined once across your supergraph in any subgraph of
your choice.

By default, all projects are created with an `AuthConfig` object in the **globals** subgraph in a `noAuth` mode that
doesn't use any auth service and doesn't allow setting session variables with API requests. Meaning that your
API is, by default, fully public and exposed if deployed live. However, you would want update the `AuthConfig` to use a
custom webhook or JWT service for authentication to restrict access to your API and make use of Hasura's powerful
[authorization](/auth/authorization/index.mdx) features. The metadata examples below can help you configure your
`AuthConfig` object to use your own custom webhook or JWT service.

You can learn more about Hasura's approach to using existing authentication systems in the
[authentication section](/auth/authentication/index.mdx).

:::info VS Code extension assisted authoring

Authentication options can be complex. As your AuthConfig object is written in an HML file, if you're using a compatible
editor (such as VS Code with the
[Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura)), assisted authoring
will help you write AuthConfig objects more efficiently. It will provide you with auto-completion, syntax highlighting,
and error checking as you create this object.
