# Business Logic

## Introduction

With Hasura, you can instantly and easily incorporate custom business logic as part of your Supergraph API using Hasura
Lambda connectors.

Transform, mutate or enrich data, connect to existing services, or extend the functionality of your native data using
functions, all hosted by Hasura or on your own infrastructure.
