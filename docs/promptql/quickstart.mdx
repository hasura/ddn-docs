# Quickstart

## Introduction

This guide will help you get started with PromptQL on Hasura DDN, allowing you to integrate AI-driven queries into your
data API.

You'll set up your Hasura DDN environment, connect a PostgreSQL data source, and enable PromptQL to unlock powerful 
natural language queries.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install the DDN CLI**

   <InstallTheCli />

2. **Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)** (needed for local development)

   The Docker based workflow helps you iterate and develop locally without deploying any changes to Hasura DDN, making
   the development experience faster and your feedback loops shorter. **You'll need Docker Compose `v2.27.1` or later.**

3. **Validate the installation**

   You can verify that the DDN CLI is installed correctly by running:

   ```sh
   ddn doctor
   ```

4. **An Anthropic key**

If you don't already have an Anthropic key, grab one [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started).

## Step 1. Set up Hasura DDN

### Step 1.1 — Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Use the following command to launch a browser window:"
ddn auth login
```

### Step 1.2 — Initialize a new local project in a new directory

```sh title="This will create a new project in an empty directory:"
ddn supergraph init mysupergraph
cd mysupergraph
```

### Step 1.3 — Connect to your PostgreSQL database

```sh title="We'll initialize a new PostgreSQL connector:"
ddn connector init my_pg -i
```

From the dropdown, start typing `postgres` and hit `ENTER`. Hit `ENTER` again to accept the recommended port.

If you don't have a PostgreSQL database, you can use this connection string:

```plaintext
postgresql://readonlyuser:yMXM2mt*vG,Rdn4+@34.71.138.6:5432/postgres
```

Set your environment variables:

| Variable         | Value                                                 | Required |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `CONNECTION_URI` | `postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/dbname` | Yes      |
| `CLIENT_CERT`    | Path to the client certificate file.                  | No       |
| `CLIENT_KEY`     | Path to the client key file.                          | No       |
| `ROOT_CERT`      | Path to the root certificate file.                    | No       |

\* Non-required environment variables can be skipped by pressing `ENTER`.

:::info Connecting a local database?

Hasura DDN uses a unique domain to resolve local services in Docker. In the connection string above, you can replace 
`hostname` with `local.hasura.dev` if you're connecting to a local database.

Additionally, if you're planning on deploying this project to Hasura DDN (our cloud-hosted service), you'll need to use
a tunnel like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose your source to the outside internet.

:::

### Step 1.4 — Introspect your PostgreSQL database

```sh title="Introspecting will create a set of configuration files so DDN knows about your source's structure:"
ddn connector introspect my_pg
```

### Step 1.5 — Add your resources

```sh title="We'll add our tables and their relationships automatically to our API:"
ddn model add my_pg "*" && ddn relationship add my_pg "*"
```

:::info Want to expose mutations?

If you'd like to be able to perform writes on your data — yes, even with PromptQL! — you'll need to also add commands:

```sh
ddn command add my_pg "*"
```

:::

### Step 1.6 — Create and run a local build or deploy to Hasura DDN

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cloud" label="Cloud-hosted project">
  
```sh title="Use the CLI to provision a new project on Hasura DDN:"
ddn project init
```

```sh title="Finally, create a new build and deploy your supergraph:"
ddn supergraph build create
```

```sh title="You now navigate to the Hasura console to test your API:"
ddn console
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Locally-running project">

```sh title="Create a local build and then run it via the CLI:"
ddn supergraph build local && ddn run docker-start
```

```sh title="You now navigate to the Hasura console to test your API:"
ddn console --local
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Try executing a query on your data to ensure you get a response back before moving on.

## Step 2. Enable PromptQL on your project

### Step 2.1 — Switch on PromptQL

If not already open, bring up the project's console by running `ddn console` from the project directory. Don't forget to
pass the `--local` flag if it's running on your machine.

Then, go to `Settings` in the bottom-left corner of the sidebar and select `PromptQL` from the project settings.

Flip the toggle on `PromptQL` and then click `Confirm`:

### Step 2.2 — Enable the playground

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cloud" label="Cloud-hosted project">

**Step 2.2.1**

Enable the PromptQL playground in the PromptQL settings:

**TODO: Add screenshot**

**Step 2.2.2**

Add your Anthropic key:

**TODO: Add screenshot**

**Step 2.2.3**

Click the PromptQL playground button in the sidenav!

**TODO: Add screenshot**

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Locally-running project">

**Step 2.2.1**

Generate a PromptQL API key and give it a name:

**TODO: Add screenshot**

Then, save the API key somewhere secure; once you close the modal, you won't be able to access it again.

**Step 2.2.2**

Next, clone the
[playground's `compose.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/promptql/refs/heads/main/playground/production.compose.yaml)
to your machine:

```sh
curl -o production.compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/promptql/refs/heads/main/playground/production.compose.yaml
```

**Step 2.2.3**

Finally, start the playground's local server with your Anthropic and PromptQL keys:

```sh
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant… PROMPTQL_SECRET_KEY=6dce… docker compose up -f production.compose.yaml
```

:::info Troubleshooting

Commonly, folks will forget to set their `HASURA_DDN_PAT` in their CLI or may have their local Hasura DDN instance
running on a different port than `3000`. To fix these issues:

```sh title="Set your PAT:"
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat)
```

```sh title="Set your HASURA_DDN_URL to the correct port"
HASURA_DDN_URL=localhost:<port>/v1/sql
```

:::

Now, you can navigate to the [chat interface](https://console.hasura.io/local/chat) and click the `Settings` icon in the
top-left; enter your playground's URL which, if you haven't made any modifications, should be `http://localhost:5000`:
