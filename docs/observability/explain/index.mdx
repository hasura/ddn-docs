# Hasura Query Plan

The Hasura v3 engine can output the GraphQL execution plan for a given query via the "explain" API.

The execution plan output is represented as a tree of type [ExplainStep](#explainstep). You can also visualize the query
plan, SQL plan, and SQL query used for each execution by clicking the `Explain query` button in your GraphiQL's request
field:

## ExplainStep

The `ExplainStep` output can be one of the following:

| ExplainStep   | Description                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ModelSelect   | A select on the data connector's model                                    |
| CommandSelect | A select on the data connector's command                                  |
| ForEach       | A for-each loop on the data returned by the parent step                   |
| HashJoin      | A hash join of the data returned by the steps to construct valid response |
| Sequence      | A sequential execution of steps                                           |
| Parallel      | A parallel execution of steps                                             |

### ModelSelect

A `ModelSelect` step represents fetching data from a [Model](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx). This includes fetching
across local relationships. For example, the following query's execution plan will be a `ModelSelect` only:

```graphql
query LocalRelationship {
  cities {
    # Backed by a model
    code
    name
    state {
      # Local relationship
      name
    }
  }
}
```

[Click here](./api-reference#modelselect) for the API reference of `ModelSelect`.

### CommandSelect

Just like the [ModelSelect](#modelselect), a `CommandSelect` represents fetching data from a
[Command](docs/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx). [Click here](./api-reference#commandselect) for the API reference of
`CommandSelect`.

### ForEach

A ForEach step represents fetching data from a `DataConnector` for each of the data from the parent node. A `ForEach`
will always be present if we need to fetch some additional data (such as from a remote
[relationship](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx)) for the data returned by the parent node. For example, the
following query's execution plan will have a `ForEach` step:

```graphql
query RemoteRelationship {
  cities {
    # Backed by a model
    code
    name
    weather {
      # Remote relationship
      forecast
    }
  }
}
```

### HashJoin

A `HashJoin` step represents joining the data fetched from two different steps. For example, the above query's execution
plan will have a `HashJoin` step for joining the `Weather` model to `City`.

### Sequence

A `Sequence` step represents a sequential execution of steps. For example, the following query's execution plan will
have a `Sequence` step (as we need to fetch a `Weather` instance for each of the `City` models fetched):

```graphql
query RemoteRelationship {
  cities {
    # Backed by a model
    code
    name
    weather {
      # Remote relationship
      forecast
    }
  }
}
```

<Thumbnail src="/img/explain/remote-relationship.png" alt="Remote relationship" width="700px" />

### Parallel

A `Parallel` step represents a parallel execution of steps. For example, the following query's execution plan will have
a `Parallel` step (as we can fetch `Department` and `Census` in parallel):

```graphql
query ParallelExecution {
  cities {
    # Backed by a model
    code
    name
    departments {
      # Remote relationship
      name
      ministers {
        name
      }
    }
    census {
      # Remote relationship
      data
    }
  }
}
```

<Thumbnail src="/img/explain/parallel-execution.png" alt="Parallel execution" width="700px" />

## Example

In the example below, for each user, we are fetching the user's name, their notifications via a local relationship, and
their favorite artists from a remote relationship:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  app_users {
    name
    # local relationship
    notifications {
      id
      message
    }
    # remote relationship
    user_to_favorite_artist {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

<Thumbnail src="/img/o11y/v0.1.1_console_explain-plan.png" alt="Explain plan example" width="700px" />

Now, from [the explain plan](/observability/explain/api-reference#example), we can understand that:

- There are three sequential steps:
  - Make a selection on the `app_users` model
  - For each user, make a selection on the `artists` model
- HashJoin the `app_user` and `artists` models to construct the response
