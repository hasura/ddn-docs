# Metrics

Hasura Data Delivery Network comes with a set of metrics that help you monitor and debug performance of your GraphQL
API. Simply head to the `Performance` tab from `Settings` for a project's Console, and you'll see performance metrics
for all your API requests.

### Request Rates
The number of requests to your GraphQL API per minute.

### Request Latency
Request latency is the time taken to execute a request to your GraphQL API. The P99 (99th percentile) metric indicates
that 99% of requests are completed within the recorded time whereas the P95 (95th percentile) metric indicates that 95%
of requests are completed within the recorded time.

### Error Rate
The percentage of requests to your GraphQL API that resulted in an error.
