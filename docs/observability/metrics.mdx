# Metrics

## Introduction

Hasura Data Delivery Network comes with a set of metrics that help you monitor and debug performance of your GraphQL
API. Simply head to the `Performance` tab from `Insights` panel for a project's Console, and you'll see performance metrics
for all your API requests.

From the performance page, metrics can be viewed for either an entire project or a single build.

## Time-series metrics

Time-series metrics are a set of metrics that are collected over time. These metrics are useful for tracking the health
of your GraphQL API and diagnosing potential failure points. **These metrics can be filtered one day at a time and are
retained for 30 days.**

### Request Rates

The number of requests to your GraphQL API per minute.

### Request Latency

Request latency is the time taken to execute a request to your GraphQL API. The P99 (99th percentile) metric indicates
that 99% of requests are completed within the recorded time whereas the P95 (95th percentile) metric indicates that 95%
of requests are completed within the recorded time.

### Error Rate

The percentage of requests to your GraphQL API that resulted in an error.
