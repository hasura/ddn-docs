# Analytics

## Introduction

Operation and Field Analytics in Hasura provides deep insights into the usage patterns of your
[models](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx) and [commands](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx).

This feature allows you to understand how your supergraph is being utilized and identify the most and least queried
portions of your supergraph. It enables you to view GraphQL field-level and operation-level analytics. By focusing on
these metrics, you can make informed decisions to optimize and enhance the functionality of your supergraph, ensuring it
meets the needs of your users effectively.
