# Field Analytics

## Introduction

Field analytics is a crucial component in understanding the granular usage patterns of your API fields. This feature
allows API producers to gain detailed insights into how specific fields within their models are being accessed and
utilized. For example, consider a [model](../../supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) `User` with fields `ID` and `Name`.
Field-level analytics enable you to determine how often `user.name` was queried over the last month and identify the
operations involved in these queries.

By tracking the frequency and context of field queries, you can make informed decisions about API evolution, performance
optimization, and data governance.

From the `Model & Field Analytics` page under `Insights` tab, you can view field analytics for either an entire project or a
single build.

## Use Cases

- **API Evolution and Deprecation:** Field analytics helps in tracking the usage of deprecated fields. By understanding
  which deprecated fields are still in use, API producers can plan the sunsetting of these fields more effectively,
  ensuring minimal disruption to consumers.
- **Operational Insights and Incident Response:** In the event of an incident, field analytics can help identify
  correlations between specific fields and operational issues. By analyzing field usage patterns, support teams can
  quickly pinpoint potential problem areas and address them efficiently.
- **Resource Optimization and Decision Making:** Understanding which fields are most and least used helps in optimizing
  data fetching strategies. API producers can allocate resources more efficiently, reduce unnecessary data processing,
  and enhance the overall performance of their APIs.

Field analytics provides API producers with the detailed insights necessary to manage and optimize their API offerings
effectively. By leveraging these insights, organizations can make informed decisions that enhance API performance,
ensure compliance, and deliver better value to their users.

## Field Summary

Field Summary provides a quick glance at the most and least accessed fields within your API. This feature categorizes
field usage into three distinct types: direct queries, usage via relationships, and usage as arguments.
These access modes help understand the operations calling fields across subgraphs and show the power of a rich federated architecture.

### Access Mode

The Access Mode provides a breakdown of the different ways in which fields are accessed within your API. This provides a very unique insight into the kind of access of your fields: `direct queries`, usage `via relationships`, and usage `as arguments`.

```graphql
query Cart_Product {
  app_cartItems(where: { productId: { _eq: "6dfe1074-65b5-11ed-8611-6a8b11ef7372" } }) {
    quantity
    cartId
    product {
      categoryId
      name
    }
  }
}
```

- **Direct Queries:** Fields accessed directly in the query without nesting. For example, in the query above, `quantity`
  and `cartId` are accessed directly.
- **Usage via Relationships:** Fields accessed in a query via relationship within a subgraph or across subgraphs. For
  example, in the query above, `product.name` is accessed via the relationship from source `app_cartItems` and
  relationship `product`.
- **Usage as Arguments:** Fields used as a argument to filter data in a query. For example, in the query above,
  `productId` is used as an argument to filter data.

## Field List

The Field List section provides a detailed breakdown of all fields within a model, their access modes, and the number of
requests made.

### Table columns

- **Field Name:** The name of the field within the model.
- **Access Mode:** The mode in which the field is accessed, such as direct queries, usage via relationships, or usage as
  arguments.
- **Number of Requests:** The total number of requests made for this field.

### Field details

Clicking on the field name in the table opens a sidebar modal that provides in-depth details about the selected field.
The Field Detail section provides a comprehensive analysis of a specific field within a model. This section is designed
to offer in-depth insights into field usage, including request patterns, the operations accessing the field, and the
context of these accesses. Such detailed visibility aids in understanding the behavior and importance of individual
fields in your API.

- **Field Requests Graph:** The Field Requests Graph provides a visual representation of the number of requests made on
  a particular field. This graph helps in identifying the usage patterns of the field by displaying the daily request
  counts. The x-axis represents the time in days, while the y-axis represents the number of requests. Each bar in the
  graph corresponds to the total number of requests made on a specific day. This information is crucial for
  understanding the load on your field and can aid in performance tuning and resource allocation.
- **Field Operations List:** The Field Operations List provides a detailed table of all operations that access a
  particular field. This table includes the operation name, access mode, relationship source, and the number of requests
  made from a particular query to that field. This comprehensive view helps in identifying and analyzing the usage
  patterns and complexities of different operations that access the field.

Clicking on the operation name in the table opens a sidebar modal that provides in-depth details about the selected
operation.
