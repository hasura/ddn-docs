# Traces

[Distributed traces](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/) track and map journeys of user requests
across various services or components.

Traces are typically used to diagnose or debug which part of your application could potentially be responsible for a
failure or error state and to monitor the performance of end-user interactions with your application.

Traces are generated by instrumenting application code. Hasura DDN instruments all API queries with the OpenTelemetry
format and supports tracing out of the box. This means that you don't even have to set up your own OpenTelemetry
collector. Just head over to the health dashboard on console and you should see traces for all your API requests.

Every request to your GraphQL API will have a unique `trace-id` associated with it and may have the following spans:
- `/graphql`
    - `handle_authentication`
        - `execute_authentication`
    - `handle_request`
        - `execute_query`
            - `execute`
                - `execute_ndc_query`
                - `execute_ndc_mutation`

| Span name                | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/graphql`               | The root span for every request to your GraphQL API. |
| `handle_authentication`  | The span responsible for handling authentication before the request is executed by the engine. |
| `execute_authentication` | The span responsible for executing authentication either using JWTs or via a Webhook. |
| `handle_request`         | The span responsible for handling a GraphQL request after it is successfully authenticated by the engine. |
| `execute_query`          | The top level span for executing a GraphQL query. |
| `execute`                | The span responsible for executing each query in your GraphQL request. This span has an attribute `usage_counts` which describes all the models that were used as a part of this operation. |
| `execute_ndc_query`      | The span responsible for executing a single ndc query. This span has an attribute `field` which describes the field that was executed.                                                      |
| `execute_ndc_mutation`   | The span responsible for executing a single ndc mutation. This span has an attribute `field` which describes the field that was executed.                                                   |
