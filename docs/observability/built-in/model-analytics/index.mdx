# Analytics

## Introduction

Operation Analytics in Hasura provides deep insights into the usage patterns of your
[models](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx) and [commands](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx).

This feature allows you to understand how your supergraph is being utilized and identify the most and least queried
portions of your supergraph. It enables you to view GraphQL operation-level analytics. By focusing on
these metrics, you can make informed decisions to optimize and enhance the functionality of your supergraph, ensuring it
meets the needs of your users effectively.

:::info Feature Availability

This feature is available from [DDN Base Plan](https://hasura.io/pricing) onwards with the retention period of one
