# Basics

## Built-in features

Hasura DDN prevents the need of adding additional observability tools to your application stack. Instead, you can use
our suite of built-in tools to monitor your API and diagnose any issues along your data pipeline.

## Exporting your metrics

If instead you choose to self-host or are an enterprise customer utilizing Private DDN and would like to configure your
own metrics collector, you can export your metrics to your OTEL-compliant service of choice.
