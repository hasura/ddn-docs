# Hasura FAQ

## What is the motivation for Hasura v3?
Hasura v3 represents a fundamental shift in how we think about data domains and is a bold response to the evolved
requirements of our users. With Hasura v3, we are introducing a new approach to data management that is designed to
provide a more powerful, flexible, agile, and scalable solution for building modern applications.

Based around the new Open Data Domain Specification, (OpenDD Spec), Hasura v3 allows an entire API layer, connecting
to almost any conceivable data source, to be declaratively scaffolded and then deployed almost instantaneously to
Hasura Cloud to deliver ultra performant production-grade APIs at the edge.

## What is the general architecture of Hasura v3?
**Hasura Cloud:** The cloud layer in Hasura v3, Hasura Cloud, includes the Data Delivery
Network (DDN) for global API performance and availability. This layer also facilitates secure tunnels for local
development using Hasura Secure Connect. Additionally, it offers tools for managing projects, builds, and environments.

**Hasura CLI:** The Hasura CLI (Command-Line Interface) serves as a powerful tool for developers to interact with the
Hasura platform. It allows users to create projects, manage metadata, create builds, and deploy APIs both locally
and in the cloud, easily.

**Metadata Modules:** Hasura v3 introduces a new way of organizing metadata through modules. Metadata is no longer a
single monolithic JSON file; instead, it's divided into _typed_ JSON files organized in collections. This modular
approach offers flexibility in organizing metadata, making it more manageable, and facilitating collaboration across
teams.

**Data Domains and Environments:** Hasura v3 enhances collaboration by introducing the concepts of data domains and
environments. Data domains allow teams to organize metadata based on their requirements, while environments enable
independent and shared infrastructure. This structure empowers teams to work autonomously while maintaining consistency
and collaboration within a shared project.

**Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD Spec):** At the heart of Hasura API development, the OpenDD Spec is a metadata
specification that defines the structure of metadata used by the Hasura runtime engine. Think of the specification as
an API contract generator helping you to reason about your data domains and model your applications and
APIs. The spec is API format agnostic and can be used by anyone to generate APIs from GraphQL, to REST, to gRPC.

**Hasura Runtime Engine:** The Hasura runtime engine is responsible for processing and serving APIs based on the
provided metadata. It has been restructured to work declaratively with metadata, utilizing the OpenDD Spec. This engine
can serve production-grade APIs from the edge with extremely high performance, as it fetches metadata on a per-request
basis and benefits from vastly improved startup times. And it's built from the ground up with Rust.

**Native Data Connector (NDC) Specification:** The NDC specification focuses on enabling the community to build data
connector agents. It supports building high-quality integrations for almost any conceivable data source, offering
features like native queries, push-down capabilities, and connection pooling. NDCs help streamline the integration
of diverse data sources into APIs.

## Is Hasura v3 faster than Hasura V1/V2?
Yes, Hasura v3 includes significant performance improvements compared to its predecessors. The optimizations implemented
in Hasura v3 aim to provide faster response times and improved scalability, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience
for your applications.

## Why Rust over Haskell?

## What are the key differences of Hasura V2 compared to Hasura v3?

## What are the main changes to the Hasura Console?

## What are the main changes to the Hasura CLI?

## What will be the benefit for me, the developer?

## Authoring the metadata file looks hard, how can I get started?

## Will pricing be different with Hasura v3?





Hasura v3 is designed to cater to the needs of developers and organizations looking for fast iteration, high developer
velocity, and performance at global scale. With its enhanced features, such as CI/CD improvements, and performance optimizations, Hasura v3 aims to provide a comprehensive
solution for building modern applications.

## 2. What are the specific actions we're going to take to accomplish these ambitious goals?
To accomplish the goals of Hasura v3, we are actively working on enhancing various aspects of the platform. This
includes continuous improvements to the authentication and authorization capabilities, streamlining CI/CD workflows,
optimizing performance at scale, and introducing features for team collaboration and governance. Our engineering team
is dedicated to delivering these enhancements through iterative development and close collaboration with our user
community.



## 4. What is the timeline for Hasura v3?
The timeline for Hasura v3 may vary depending on the specific features and enhancements being developed. We are
committed to delivering a stable and reliable release, and our engineering team is working diligently to ensure a
timely rollout. For the most up-to-date information on the timeline, we recommend referring to our official
announcements and releases.
