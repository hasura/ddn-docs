# Hasura FAQ

## What is Hasura DDN?

Hasura DDN represents a fundamental shift in how we think about data domains and is a bold response to the evolved
requirements of our users. With Hasura DDN, we are introducing a new approach to API management that is designed to
provide, both in developer workflow and final product: a faster, more powerful, agile, and scalable solution for
building modern applications.

Based around the new Open Data Domain Specification, (OpenDD spec), Hasura DDN allows an entire API layer, connecting to
almost any conceivable data source, to be declaratively scaffolded and then deployed almost instantaneously to Hasura
Cloud to deliver ultra-performant production-grade APIs at the edge.

## Will Hasura DDN be compatible with Hasura v1/v2?

The default generated GraphQL schema of Hasura DDN is compatible with v2 schemas. However, Hasura DDN is a complete
re-architecture of the Hasura platform and we will provide migration tools to move v2 metadata to DDN.

## Will Hasura v2 be supported after Hasura DDN is released?

We will still support, maintain and improve Hasura v2 for the near future and will be providing migration tools to move
Hasura v2 deployments to DDN. At some point, when Hasura DDN has achieved feature parity with v2, we will begin the v2
deprecation process and keep the community notified and informed. To be clear, Hasura DDN is the future of Hasura and we
will be investing heavily in it going forward.

## What is the general architecture of Hasura DDN?

**Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD Spec):** At the heart of Hasura API development is the OpenDD spec. It is a
specification that defines the structure of metadata used by the Hasura runtime engine. Think of the specification as an
API contract generator helping you to reason about your data domains and model your applications and APIs.

**Native Data Connector (NDC) Specification:** The NDC specification focuses on enabling the community to build data
connector agents. It supports building high-quality integrations for almost any conceivable data source, offering
features like native queries, push-down capabilities, and connection pooling. NDCs help streamline the integration of
diverse data sources into APIs.

**Hasura Runtime Engine:** The Hasura Engine is responsible for processing and serving APIs based on the provided
metadata. It has been restructured to work declaratively with metadata, utilizing the OpenDD spec. This engine can serve
production-grade APIs from the edge with extremely high performance, as it fetches metadata on a per-request basis and
benefits from vastly improved startup times. And it's built from the ground up with Rust.

**Hasura Cloud:** The cloud layer in Hasura DDN, Hasura Cloud, introduces the Data Delivery Network (DDN) for global API
performance and availability. This layer also facilitates secure tunnels for local development using Hasura Secure
Connect and also offers tools for managing projects.

**Hasura CLI:** The new Hasura CLI (Command-Line Interface), rebuilt in Rust, serves as a powerful tool for developers
to interact with the Hasura platform. It allows users to create projects, manage metadata, create builds, and deploy
production APIs both locally and in the cloud, easily.

**Hasura Console:** The Hasura Console offers a graphical interface for viewing metadata. Users can also run queries on
their API with GraphiQL.

**Namespaces:** Namespaces is a feature that allows users to differentiate and organize their fields and related types
within the Hasura metadata. It helps in avoiding conflicts when there are, for example, tables with the same names in
different data sources. By using namespaces, users can namespace a conflicting table and all related types. In addition
to aesthetic preference, resolving conflicts and maintaining a clean and organized GraphQL schema, namespaces also
ensures a more systematic approach to schema customization and naming.

## Is a Hasura DDN API faster than a Hasura v2 API?

Yes. Hasura DDN includes significant performance improvements compared to its predecessors. The optimizations
implemented in Hasura DDN aim to provide faster response times and improved scalability, ensuring a smooth and efficient
experience for your applications and users.

## What will be the benefit for me, the developer?

- A single spec to define your whole API.
- Connect to any data with Native Data Connectors (NDCs).
- Deploy with lightning speed and sub-second CI/CD.
- Work better with your team with improved version control and collaboration features.
- Unparalleled performance at any scale with optimized query execution and caching mechanisms.
- Serverless runtime system for improved efficiency and reduced latency.
- Benefit from Rust's performance and ecosystem in the refactored Hasura runtime engine.
- Access a global edge network for low-latency, high-performance APIs with the Data Delivery Network (DDN).

## What CI/CD features does Hasura DDN offer?

**Sub-Second CI/CD:** Hasura brings sub-second CI/CD capabilities, enabling developers to test and validate changes
rapidly.

**CLI-Controlled Deployments:** The Hasura Command-Line Interface (CLI) plays a central role in controlling and managing
deployments. It allows developers to create builds and promote them to production. This CLI-centric approach simplifies
the deployment process.

**Builds and Project Shares:** With Hasura, metadata states are represented as builds. Once a build is thoroughly tested
and validated, it can be applied to a project and made available to API consumers globally. This separation of build and
production steps ensures a smoother transition from development to production.

**Extremely Fast Builds:** Hasura also introduces cloud innovations that allow metadata builds to be created in under
one second, regardless of the number of models. This means that deploying even a large number of models is a swift and
seamless process and developers can rapidly test multiple deployments within a day.

**Zero Downtime Rollouts:** With Hasura, going to production is facilitated without restarts and with zero downtime.
This ensures that your API remains available to users while updates are being applied.

**Metadata Version Control:** Hasura includes in-product metadata version control. Each build is associated with a
unique build ID, making it easier to track and manage different versions of your metadata. This enhances transparency
and auditability during the deployment process.

## How does Hasura DDN connect to data sources?

Native Data Connectors (NDC) are a framework introduced in Hasura DDN that enables developers to build custom data
connector agents. These agents facilitate the integration between Hasura and external data sources, allowing Hasura to
seamlessly interact with a wide range of databases, services, and APIs. NDCs can be built for almost any conceivable
source of data and are the only way to connect to data sources in Hasura DDN.

## Is Hasura DDN open source?

Some elements of Hasura DDN will be open-sourced and some will not.

## Will pricing be different with Hasura DDN?

Our goal with pricing for Hasura DDN is to be half the cost compared to any self-hosted DIY API server at any scale. The
aim is to provide a more competitive price point for DIY API developers to adopt and to invest in serverless pricing to
provide a massive performance/cost benefit ratio to large enterprise.

## Why Rust over Haskell?

We have a lot of love for Haskell. It's a beautiful language that we have been using for the Hasura engine since the
beginning, and will still be using it on Hasura v2. Without going into the weeds in a FAQ, we wanted to benefit from
Rust's performance, ecosystem and community for DDN. Rust is a modern, high-performance, and memory-safe language. It is
also gaining a lot of traction in the cloud-native space, and we are excited to be using it for the majority of the
Hasura DDN codebase.

## What is the timeline for Hasura DDN?

The timeline for Hasura DDN may vary depending on the specific features and enhancements being developed. We are
committed to delivering a stable and reliable release, and the team is working diligently to ensure a timely rollout.
For the most up-to-date information on the timeline, we recommend referring to our
[official announcements and releases](/community.mdx).

## Authoring metadata looks hard, how can I get started?

The Hasura LSP (Language Server Protocol)
[plugin for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) and other editors will help you
get started with authoring if you want to do it by hand. It includes autocomplete and validation for the metadata file.
