# Hasura FAQ

## What is the motivation for Hasura v3?

Hasura v3 represents a fundamental shift in how we think about data domains and is a bold response to the evolved
requirements of our users. With Hasura v3, we are introducing a new approach to API management that is designed to
provide a faster, more powerful, agile, and scalable solution for building modern applications.

Based around the new Open Data Domain Specification, (OpenDD Spec), Hasura v3 allows an entire API layer, connecting
to almost any conceivable data source, to be declaratively scaffolded and then deployed almost instantaneously to
Hasura Cloud to deliver ultra-performant production-grade APIs at the edge.

## Will Hasura v3 be backwards compatible with Hasura v1/v2?

No, Hasura v3 is not backwards compatible with Hasura v1/v2. Hasura v3 is a complete re-architecture of the Hasura
platform.

## Will Hasura v2 be supported after Hasura v3 is released?

We will still support, maintain and improve Hasura v2 for the near future and will be providing migration tools to
move Hasura v2 deployments to v3. At some point when Hasura v3 has achieved feature parity with v2, we will
begin the deprecation process. To be clear, Hasura v3 is the future of Hasura and we will be investing heavily in
it going forward.

## What is the general architecture of Hasura v3?

**Hasura Cloud:** The cloud layer in Hasura v3, Hasura Cloud, includes the Data Delivery
Network (DDN) for global API performance and availability. This layer also facilitates secure tunnels for local
development using Hasura Secure Connect and also offers tools for managing projects, builds, and environments.

**Hasura CLI:** The new Hasura CLI (Command-Line Interface), rebuilt in Rust, serves as a powerful tool for
developers to interact with the Hasura platform. It allows users to create projects, manage metadata, create builds,
and deploy production APIs both locally and in the cloud, easily.

**Hasura Console:** The Hasura Console offers a graphical interface for viewing metadata. Users
can also run queries on their API with GraphiQL.

**Metadata Modules:** Hasura v3 introduces a new way of organizing metadata through modules. Metadata is no longer a
single monolithic JSON blob; instead, it's divided into _typed_ JSON files organized in collections. This modular
approach offers flexibility in organizing metadata, making it more manageable, and facilitating collaboration across
teams.

**Data Domains and Environments:** Hasura v3 enhances collaboration by introducing the concepts of data domains and
environments. Data domains allow teams to organize metadata based on their requirements, while environments enable
independent and shared infrastructure. This structure empowers teams to work both autonomously and collaboratively
within a shared project.

**Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD Spec):** At the heart of Hasura API development is the OpenDD Spec. It is a
metadata specification that defines the structure of metadata used by the Hasura runtime engine. Think of the
specification as an API contract generator helping you to reason about your data domains and model your applications
and APIs. The spec is API format agnostic and can be used by anyone to generate APIs from GraphQL, to REST, to gRPC.

**Hasura Runtime Engine:** The Hasura Engine is responsible for processing and serving APIs based on the
provided metadata. It has been restructured to work declaratively with metadata, utilizing the OpenDD Spec. This engine
can serve production-grade APIs from the edge with extremely high performance, as it fetches metadata on a per-request
basis and benefits from vastly improved startup times. And it's built from the ground up with Rust.

**Native Data Connector (NDC) Specification:** The NDC specification focuses on enabling the community to build data
connector agents. It supports building high-quality integrations for almost any conceivable data source, offering
features like native queries, push-down capabilities, and connection pooling. NDCs help streamline the integration
of diverse data sources into APIs.

## Is a Hasura v3 API faster than Hasura v1/v2?

Yes. Hasura v3 includes significant performance improvements compared to its predecessors. The optimizations implemented
in Hasura v3 aim to provide faster response times and improved scalability, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience
for your applications.

## What will be the benefit for me, the developer?

- A single spec to define your whole API
- Connect to any data with Native Data Connectors (NDCs)
- Deploy with lightning speed with sub second CI/CD
- Work better with your team with improved version control and collaboration features.
- Unparalleled performance at any scale with optimized query execution and caching mechanisms
- Serverless runtime system for improved efficiency and reduced latency.
- Benefit from Rust's performance and ecosystem in the refactored Hasura runtime engine
- Access a global edge network for low-latency, high-performance APIs with the Data Delivery Network (DDN).
- Extend the functionality Hasura v3 with custom modules.


## What CI/CD features does Hasura v3 offer?

**Sub-Second CI/CD:** Hasura v3 brings sub-second CI/CD capabilities, enabling developers to test and validate changes
rapidly.

**CLI-Controlled Deployments:** The Hasura Command-Line Interface (CLI) plays a central role in controlling and managing
deployments. It allows developers to create builds, apply them to projects, and keep track of the deployed versions.
This CLI-centric approach simplifies the deployment process.

**Builds and Project Shares:** With Hasura v3, metadata states are represented as builds. Once a build is thoroughly
tested and validated, it can be applied to a project and shared with API consumers globally. This separation of build
and production steps ensures a smoother transition from development to production.

**Extremely Fast Builds:** Hasura v3 also introduces cloud innovations that allow metadata builds to be created in
under one second, regardless of the number of models. This means that deploying even a large number of models is a
swift and seamless process and developers can rapidly test multiple deploys within a day

**Zero Downtime Rollouts:** With Hasura v3, going to production is facilitated without restarts and with zero downtime.
This ensures that your API remains available to users while updates are being applied.

**Metadata Version Control:** Hasura v3 includes in-product metadata version control. Each build is associated with a
unique build ID, making it easier to track and manage different versions of your metadata. This enhances transparency
and auditability during the deployment process.


## How does Hasura v3 connect to data sources?

Native Data Connectors (NDC) are a framework introduced in Hasura v3 that enables developers to build custom data
connector agents. These agents facilitate the integration between Hasura and external data sources, allowing Hasura to
seamlessly interact with a wide range of databases, services, and APIs. NDCs can be build for almost any conceivable
source of data and are the only way to connect to data sources in Hasura v3.

## Is Hasura v3 open source?

Some elements of Hasura v3 will be open sourced and some will not.

[//]: # (## Authoring the metadata file looks hard, how can I get started?)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (The Hasura Console can automatically generate metadata for you based on your database schema. You can also refer to)

[//]: # (the documentation )

## Will pricing be different with Hasura v3?
Our goal with pricing for Hasura v3 is to be half the cost compared to any self-hosted DIY API server at
any scale. The aim is to provide a more competitive price point for DIY API developers to adopt and to invest in
serverless pricing to provide a massive performance/cost benefit ratio to large enterprise.

## Why Rust over Haskell?
We have a lot of love for Haskell. It's a beautiful language that we have been using for the Hasura engine since
the beginning, and will still be using it on Hasura v2. Without going into the weeds in a FAQ, we wanted to benefit from
Rust's performance, ecosystem and community in v3. Rust is a modern, high-performance, and memory-safe language. It
is also gaining a lot of traction in the cloud-native space, and we are excited to be using it for the majority of
the Hasura v3 codebase.

## What is the timeline for Hasura v3?
The timeline for Hasura v3 may vary depending on the specific features and enhancements being developed. We are
committed to delivering a stable and reliable release, and the team is working diligently to ensure a timely rollout.
For the most up-to-date information on the timeline, we recommend referring to our official
announcements and releases.
