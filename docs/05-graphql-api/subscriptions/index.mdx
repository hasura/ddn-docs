# GraphQL Subscriptions

GraphQL subscriptions allow you to push real-time updates from your database to clients, making them ideal for building
reactive applications without constant polling.

Subscriptions are supported for the following queries:

- [Select unique](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx#model-selectuniquegraphqldefinition)
- [Select many](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx#model-selectmanygraphqldefinition)
- [Aggregate](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx#model-modelaggregategraphqldefinition)

Example:

```graphql
subscription UserNotificationSubscription {
  notifications(where: { user_id: { _eq: 123 } }) {
    id
    created_at
    message
  }
}
```

## Enabling Subscriptions

You can enable subscriptions on your GraphQL API in the following ways:

### New Hasura DDN Project

If you're starting fresh, set up a Hasura DDN project using the [quickstart](/quickstart.mdx) guide. After adding your
models to the supergraph using the [`ddn model add`](/cli/commands/ddn_model_add.mdx) command, subscription capabilities
are automatically generated! For further customization, you can [edit the metadata](#metadata-configuration).

### Existing Hasura DDN Project

To enable subscriptions in an existing DDN project, use the following CLI command:

```bash
ddn codemod upgrade-graphqlconfig-subscriptions
```

This command updates the local metadata files, adding subscription-specific configurations. After running this, create a
supergraph build and test the subscriptions on the API. For further customization, you can
[edit the metadata](#metadata-configuration).

### Metadata Configuration

You can also configure subscriptions by editing the metadata in your DDN project.

#### Root Type Name

Set or update the subscription root type in your GraphQL API by modifying the `graphql-config.hml` file located at
`globals/metadata/graphql-config.hml`. This ensures the subscription root type is defined, which is necessary for
enabling subscriptions. You will have to add the following in the `definition` for
[`GraphqlConfig`](/supergraph-modeling/graphql-config.mdx#graphqlconfig-graphqlconfig)

```yaml
subscription:
  rootOperationTypeName: Subscription
```

Example:

```yaml {8-9} title="<project-root>/globals/metadata/graphql-config.hml"
kind: GraphqlConfig
version: v1
definition:
  query:
    rootOperationTypeName: Query
  mutation:
    rootOperationTypeName: Mutation
  subscription:
    rootOperationTypeName: Subscription
```

#### Model Root Field

For each model, update the root field name for subscriptions in the corresponding model's HML file. You can also
configure other optional parameters, such as the [polling interval](#polling-interval), the root field's description,
and its deprecation status.

An example of an `Article` [model definition](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx#model-model) with subscriptions enabled
for the `selectMany`, `selectUniques`, and `aggregate` root fields:

```yaml {13-15,20-24,29-30} title="<project-root>/<subgraph-name>/metadata/Article.hml"
kind: Model
version: v1
definition:
  name: Article
  objectType: Article
  source:
    dataConnectorName: my_connector
    collection: article
  aggregateExpression: ArticleAggExp
  graphql:
    selectMany:
      queryRootField: article
      subscription:
        rootField: article
        description: Subscribe to article model
    selectUniques:
      - queryRootField: articleById
        uniqueIdentifier:
          - id
        subscription:
          rootFIeld: articleById
          description: Subscribe to article model by its unique id
          deprecated:
            reason: Use article root field with filters
    orderByExpressionType: ArticleOrderBy
    filterInputTypeName: ArticleFilterInput
    aggregate:
      queryRootField: articleAggregate
      subscription:
        rootField: articleAggregate
```

#### Polling Interval

You can set the polling interval (in milliseconds) within the model's
[GraphQL definition](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx#model-modelgraphqldefinition) to determine how often the engine
checks for updates. If not specified, the interval defaults to `1000` milliseconds (1 second).

An example of an `Article` [model definition](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx#model-model) that has a custom polling
interval configured for the `selectMany` subscription field:

```yaml {15} title="<project-root>/<subgraph-name>/metadata/Article.hml"
kind: Model
version: v1
definition:
  name: Article
  objectType: Article
  source:
    dataConnectorName: my_connector
    collection: article
  aggregateExpression: ArticleAggExp
  graphql:
    selectMany:
      queryRootField: article
      subscription:
        rootField: article
        pollingIntervalMs: 2000 # 2 seconds
    orderByExpressionType: ArticleOrderBy
    filterInputTypeName: ArticleFilterInput
```

##### Polling intervals and performance

Choosing the right polling interval is key to the performance and stability of your subscription API. Setting too short
an interval can overburden your database with excessive queries, which can degrade performance, especially in
high-traffic environments. Conversely, setting too long an interval may delay critical updates, making your real-time
application less responsive.

For example, a short interval might be necessary for live sports score updates or stock trading platforms where
real-time precision is critical. A longer interval could be suitable for use cases like updating daily sales reports, or
sending periodic system health metricsâ€”scenarios where updates are not urgent, and system stability is prioritized over
immediate data freshness. The default setting of 1 second is chosen to accommodate most use cases, but should be
adjusted based on your specific real-time needs.

#### Permissions

Access to subscription root fields is managed through the `select`
[permission definition](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#modelpermissions-selectpermission). To allow a role to use
subscriptions for a specific model, set `allowSubscriptions` to `true` in the model's
[permission definition](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#modelpermissions-modelpermissions).

Example of a select permission for an `Article` model with subscriptions allowed for the `user` role:

```yaml {9} title="<project-root>/<subgraph-name>/metadata/Article.hml"
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Article
  permissions:
    - role: user
      select:
        filter: null
        allowSubscriptions: true
```
