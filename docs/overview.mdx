Welcome to the overview introduction of Hasura V3! In this documentation, we will explore the main benefits and
architecture of Hasura V3.

Hasura V3 has been designed with a focus on modularization and composability, aiming to provide individual developers
with increased autonomy and fast prototyping capabilities. The architecture of Hasura V3 revolves around two main
personas: the API Developer and the agent author.

The API Developer is empowered to build rich APIs using Hasura V3. One of the key pillars of the V3 architecture is the
Open Data Domain Specification, which has replaced the previous GraphQL Data specification. This new specification
dictates the metadata structure that the Hasura runtime engine accepts. To assist API Developers, Hasura V3 offers a
range of tooling, including text editor plugins, an enhanced CLI, and a fully refactored console. These tools enable API
Developers to author metadata according to the new structure, providing a streamlined experience.

The agent author, on the other hand, can leverage Hasura V3 to build rich integrations with data sources. The V3
architecture introduces features such as metadata namespaces and environments (coming soon), which enhance team
collaboration and provide a more organized approach to managing metadata.

Hasura V3 also places a strong emphasis on meeting strict SLAs around performance, security, and reliability. The
architecture is designed to ensure unparalleled performance at any scale, enabling end users to have a seamless
experience. Additionally, Hasura V3 addresses concerns around data privacy and control, striking a balance between
giving developers autonomy and maintaining strict controls.

As you explore this documentation, you will find detailed information on various aspects of Hasura V3, including the
CLI, migrations, team collaboration, security, and more. We also provide a roadmap to keep you informed about future
developments.

Please note that this documentation is focused specifically on the V3 architecture of Hasura. If you are looking for
information on migrating from Hasura V2, a migration guide will be available soon.
