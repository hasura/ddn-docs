# Namespaces

:::danger Coming Soon

Stay tuned. Namespaces are coming soon to Hasura DDN.

:::

For a multi-team organization working on a Hasura project, it can make sense for any one team to not have access to all
metadata objects. Namespaces introduces the notion of a module system for metadata.

A project can have a collection of namespaces and the project's metadata becomes the 'union' of metadata objects across
all namespaces of the project. Each namespace can then be accessed and updated independently.

Metadata with namespaces looks something like the following:

```yaml
namespaces:
  - name: foo
    objects:
      - kind: AuthConfig
        allowRoleEmulationFor: admin
        webhook:
          webhookUrl: "http://localhost:3050/validate-request"
      - <metadata obj>
      # Add more objects here as needed
  - <metadata objects with namespace>
  # Add more namespaces with their respective objects here as needed
```

## Ownership Rules

The metadata objects in namespaces must follow the ownership rules for metadata objects as outlined below.

### DataSource/ HasuraHubDataSource

The data source metadata object (`DataSource`/ `HasuraHubDataSource`) doesn't depend on (or reference) any other
metadata object. Hence, any namespace can define a data source.

:::info Namespace ownership

The namespace that defines a data source then owns it. This means that no other namespace can reference this data source
in their type representations, model, etc.

Violating this rule will result in the metadata build failing with the error,
`unable to build schema: metadata is not consistent: the following data source is defined more than once: <data source name>`.

:::

### ObjectType

The `ObjectType` metadata object also doesn't reference any other metadata object. Thus, any namespace can define an
`ObjectType`.

### DataConnectorScalarRepresentation

The `DataConnectorScalarRepresentation` metadata object references the data source metadata object. Thus, the data
source in a `DataConnectorScalarRepresentation` should be owned by the **same** namespace.

### ScalarType

The `ScalarType` metadata object also doesn't reference any other metadata object. Thus, **any** namespace can define a
`ScalarType`.

### Model

A `Model` metadata object references a data type. Also, the model's `source` references a data source and some data
types in type mappings. **Thus, the same namespace should own the types and the data source.**

### Command

A `Command` metadata object references an output data type. Thus, the namespace defining the `Command` metadata object
should also define the output data type.

### Relationship

The `Relationship` metadata object references a source type and a target model. The source type used in the
`Relationship` should be owned by the namespace defining the `Relationship`.

:::info Target type ownership

The target type can be from any namespace. This allows us to define relationships across namespaces.

:::

### TypeOutputPermissions

The `TypeOutputPermissions` metadata object references a type (for which the permission is being defined). Thus, the
namespace defining the `TypeOutputPermissions` should own the type referenced.

### ModelSelectPermissions

Similar to `TypeOutputPermissions`, the namespace should also own the model referenced in the `ModelSelectPermissions`
metadata object.

### CommandPermissions

The `CommandPermissions` metadata object references a command, which should be defined in the same namespace.

### AuthConfig

Any namespace can define this.

:::info Only one auth config allowed per project

There can be only one `AuthConfig` in the project's metadata. i.e. only one namespace can define one `AuthConfig`, if
there are more than one `AuthConfig`, then the metadata build will fail with the error
`Found duplicate authentication config`.

:::

## Other Rules

Apart from ownership rules, metadata with namespaces should also follow the following rules:

### Duplicate Namespaces

Metadata should not define two namespaces with same name.

### Duplicate Metadata Objects

Metadata should also not define the same metadata object twice (either in the same namespace or in different
namespaces). If you violate this rule, then the metadata build will fail with the error
`namespace constraints violated - found multiple namespaces with the same name`.
