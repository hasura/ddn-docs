# Environments

## Introduction

Environments allow you to organize your [project](/ci-cd/projects.mdx) metadata by development or prouction lifecycle or any other criteria that makes sense
for your organization. Environments are also used to manage [builds](/ci-cd/builds.mdx) for a project.

## Environment lifecycle

### Create

You can create a new environment using the CLI by running:

```bash
hasura3 cloud environment create --project <PATH_TO_hasura.yaml> --name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

### Manage

Once you've created an environment, you can then use it to create different builds by configuring your `build-profile.yaml` to
reference the environment name under the `environments` key:

```yaml
version: 1
spec:
  # highlight-start
  environment: staging
  # highlight-end
  namespaces:
    - name: default
      resources:
        - ./metadata.hml
```

In the example above, the `staging` environment, which would have been created in the previous step, is used for the
build.

We can title this file `build-profile-staging.yaml` and then reference it in the `hasura.yaml` file as an item in the
array of `buildProfiles`:

```yaml
version: 1
project: <PROJECT_ID>

buildProfiles:
  - build-profile.yaml
  # highlight-start
  - build-profile-staging.yaml
  # highlight-end
  - build-profile-staging-patch.yaml

defaultBuildProfile: build-profile.yaml
```

### Delete

You can delete an environment using the CLI by running:

```bash
hasura3 cloud environment remove --project <PATH_TO_hasura.yaml> --name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```
