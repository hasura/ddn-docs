# Environments

## Introduction

Environments allow you to organize your [project](/ci-cd/projects.mdx) metadata by `development` or `production` for
your organization. Environments are also used to manage [builds](/ci-cd/builds.mdx) for a project.

Once you've created an environment you can then use it to create different builds by configuring a build profile file
for it. You'll then be able to access this environment's applied build via a different API endpoint.

## Environment lifecycle

### Create

You can create a new environment on Hasura DDN using the CLI by running:

```bash
hasura3 environment create --name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

The CLI will return a response specifying the fully-qualified domain name of the environment, such as:

```text
+------+--------------------------------------------+
| Name | testing                                    |
+------+--------------------------------------------+
| Fqdn | secure-catfish-9299-testing.ddn.hasura.app |
+------+--------------------------------------------+
```

In the Console, you'll now see the environment listed as an option in the Project and you can select it to view the
builds for that environment.

### Manage

Once you've created an environment, you can then use it to create different builds by configuring a build profile file
to reference the environment name under the `environments` key:

```yaml
# build-profile-staging.yaml
version: 2
spec:
  # highlight-start
  environment: staging
  # highlight-end
  mode: replace
  supergraph:
    resources:
      - supergraph-staging/*
  subgraphs:
    - name: default
      resources:
        - "subgraphs/staging/**/*.hml"
```

In the example above, the `staging` environment, which would have been created in the previous step, is used for the
build.

We can title this file `build-profile-staging.yaml` and then reference it in the `hasura.yaml` file as an item in the
array of `buildProfiles`:

```yaml
version: 1
project: secure-catfish-9299

buildProfiles:
  - build-profile.yaml
  - build-profile-staging.yaml

defaultBuildProfile: build-profile.yaml
```

### Delete

You can delete an environment using the CLI by running:

```bash
hasura3 environment delete --name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```
