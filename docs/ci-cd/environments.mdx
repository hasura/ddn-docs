# Environments

## Introduction

Environments allow you to organize your [project](/ci-cd/projects.mdx) metadata by creating different environments for
different stages of your development lifecycle. You can create environments for `development`, `staging`, and
`production` and then use them to create different builds for each environment.

## Environment lifecycle

### Create

You can create a new environment on Hasura DDN using the CLI by running:

```bash
ddn create environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

The CLI will return a response specifying the fully-qualified domain name of the environment, such as:

```text
+------+--------------------------------------------+
| Name | testing                                    |
+------+--------------------------------------------+
| Fqdn | secure-catfish-9299-testing.ddn.hasura.app |
+------+--------------------------------------------+
```

In the Console, you'll now see the environment listed as an option in the project and you can select it to view the
builds for that environment.

### Manage

Once you've created an environment, you can then use it to create different builds by configuring a manifest file to
reference the environment name under the `environments` key:

```yaml
# stage.supergraph.hml
kind: SupergraphManifest
version: v1
definition:
  environment: staging
  name: stage
  mode: replace
  envfile: .local.yaml
  supergraph:
    resources:
      - supergraph/**/*.hml
  subgraphs:
    - name: app
      resources:
        - app/**/*.hml
      connectors:
        app_connector:
          path: app/app_connector
          manifestFile: app_connector.build.hml
        app_functions:
          path: app/app_functions
          manifestFile: app_functions.build.hml
```

In the example above, the `staging` environment, which would have been created in the previous step, is used for the
build.

We can title this file `stage.supergraph.hml` and then reference it in the `hasura.yaml` file as an item in the array of
`supergraphManifests`:

```yaml
version: 1
project: <PROJECT_NAME>

supergraphManifests:
  - base.supergraph.hml
  - stage.supergraph.hml

defaultSupergraphManifest: base.supergraph.hml
```

### Delete

You can delete an environment using the CLI by running:

```bash
ddn delete environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```
