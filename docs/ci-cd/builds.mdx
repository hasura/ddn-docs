# Builds

## Introduction

A build is a fully-functional, immutable [supergraph](/basics/core-concepts.mdx#supergraph) which is built based on your
project configuration.

Builds are created for a specific [**environment**](/ci-cd/environments.mdx) and can be used to incrementally test your
project's API.

While there can be many builds for an environment, only one can be **applied** at a time to an environment. The applied
build is the one that is currently serving your API from an environment's endpoint.

## Build lifecycle

### Create

To create a build, you'll first need a [**project**](/ci-cd/projects.mdx). After which, you can create a build using the
following command:

```bash
ddn build supergraph
```

The CLI will return information about your build:

```text
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Build ID      | 7af001cc-5fdd-4638-aa23-96c49cd45d42                             |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Build Version | 606b3d797d                                                       |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Build URL     | https://stunning-eagle-6335-dev-606b3d797d.ddn.hasura.me/graphql |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Project Id    | 3172bf76-1d6f-4869-9ee2-7147b964cc5e                             |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Console Url   | https://console.hasura.com/project/stunning-eagle-6335/graphql   |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| FQDN          | stunning-eagle-6335-dev-606b3d797d.ddn.hasura.me                 |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Environment   | dev                                                              |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Description   |                                                                  |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

#### Overriding the default manifest

By default, the build will be created using the manifest you've identified as the default for your project in your
`hasura.yaml` file. You can override this by specifying a different manifest using the `--supergraph-manifest` flag:

```bash
ddn build supergraph --supergraph-manifest <MANIFEST_FILE>
```

At this point, you can interact with and test your API using the GraphQL API endpoint and Console URL returned by the
CLI.

### Apply

When you are happy with your build, you can apply it to an environment using the following command:

```bash
ddn apply supergraph-build <build-version>
```

The CLI will return the API endpoint for your supergraph:

```text
+---------+----------------------------------------------------+
| API URL | https://secure-catfish-9299.ddn.hasura.app/graphql |
+---------+----------------------------------------------------+
```

### Delete

Builds can be individually deleted using the following command:

```bash
ddn delete supergraph-build --version <BUILD_VERSION>
```

All builds for a project are deleted when a [project is deleted](/ci-cd/projects.mdx#delete).
