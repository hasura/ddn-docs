# Builds

## Introduction

A build is a fully-functional, immutable supergraph which is built based on your project configuration.

Builds are created for a specific [**project**](/ci-cd/projects.mdx) and can be used to incrementally test your API.

While there can be many builds for a project, only one can be **applied** at a time. The applied build is the one that
is currently serving your API from your project's endpoint.

## Build lifecycle

### Create

To create a build, you'll first need a [**project**](/ci-cd/projects.mdx). After which, you can create a build using the
following command:

```bash
hasura3 build create
```

The CLI will return information about your build:

```text
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Build ID      | baa7f15d-5364-4cfd-b94c-8d2a8a51e6e2                          |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Build Version | b6370d7d56                                                    |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Build URL     | https://secure-catfish-9299-b6370d7d56.ddn.hasura.app/graphql |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Project Id    | fc2d7717-e1f8-4213-9132-6a70f78b6026                          |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Console Url   | https://console.hasura.io/project/secure-catfish-9299/graphql |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| FQDN          | secure-catfish-9299-b6370d7d56.ddn.hasura.app                 |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Environment   | default                                                       |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Description   |                                                               |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

By default, the build will be created using the build profile you've identified as the default for your project in your
`hasura.yaml` file. You can override this by specifying a different profile using the `--profile` flag:

```bash
hasura3 build create --profile <BUILD_PROFILE_FILE>
```

At this point, you can interact with and test your API using the GraphQL API Endpoint and Console URL returned by the
CLI.

### Apply

When you are happy with your build, you can apply it to a project's environment using the following command:

```bash
hasura3 build apply --version <BUILD_VERSION>
```

The CLI will return the API endpoint for your supergraph:

```text
+---------+----------------------------------------------------+
| API URL | https://secure-catfish-9299.ddn.hasura.app/graphql |
+---------+----------------------------------------------------+
```

### Delete

Builds can be individually deleted using the following command:

```bash
hasura3 build delete --version <BUILD_VERSION>
```

All builds for a project are deleted when a [project is deleted](/ci-cd/projects.mdx/#delete).
