# Builds

## Introduction

A build is a fully-functional, immutable supergraph which is built based on your `metadata.hml` file.

A build takes the `metadata.hml` file, as it exists when you create the build, and constructs your supergraph from it.
Builds are created for a specific [**project**](/ci-cd/projects.mdx) and can be used to incrementally test your API as
you make changes to your `metadata.hml` file.

While there can be many builds for a project, only one can be **applied** at a time. The applied build is the one that
is currently serving your API from your project's endpoint.

## Build lifecycle

### Create

To create a build, you'll first need a [**project**](/ci-cd/projects.mdx) with a valid `metadata.hml` configured. After
which, you can create a build using the following command:

```bash
hasura3 build create --project-id <PROJECT_ID> --metadata-file <METADATA_FILE>
```

The CLI will return information about your build:

```text
 Creating build... ok
 Project ID            <PROJECT_ID>
 Build ID              <BUILD_ID>
 Build Version         <BUILD_VERSION>
 GraphQL API Endpoint  <GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT_FOR_BUILD>
 Console URL           <CONSOLE_LINK_FOR_BUILD>
```

At this point, you can interact with and test your API using the GraphQL API Endpoint and Console URL returned by the
CLI.

### Apply

When you are happy with your build, you can apply it to your project — **meaning it will be used to serve your supergraph
via the project's endpoint** — using the following command:

```bash
hasura3 build apply --project-id <PROJECT_ID> --build-id <BUILD_ID>
```

### Delete

Builds can be individually deleted using the following command:

```bash
hasura3 build remove --project-id <PROJECT_ID> --build-version <BUILD_VERSION>
```

All builds for a project are deleted when a [project is deleted](/ci-cd/projects.mdx/#delete).
