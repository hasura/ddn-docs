```
hasura3 Usage: hasura3 [COMMAND]

Commands:
  local  Commands related to local Hasura Ops
  cloud  Commands related to Hasura Cloud Ops
  cli    Hasura CLI ops
  help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:

  -V, --version  Print version

```

## Building From Source

### Prerequisites

1. [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
2. [Just](https://just.systems/)
   - Install using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
     ```
     cargo install just
     ```
   - Refer to the [Just docs](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_3.html) for other installation methods
3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Steps

1. Build the Plugins CLI binaries by running the following commands. These are required for the CLI to be built.

```
cd v3-cli/plugin
just build-plugin-cli
```

Don't worry if the step to upload artifacts fails. The build should succeed. You should find the binaries in
`v3-cli/crates/cli/_output_plugin_cli`

2. Build & install the v3 CLI by executing the following commands

```bash
cd v3-cli/crates/cli
just install

```

- This command will place the `hasura3` binary in `$HOME/.cargo/bin/`. Make sure it is in your `PATH`.

3. Verify installation by running

```bash
hasura3
```

This should return:

```text
hasura3

Commands:
  local   Commands related to local Hasura Ops
  cloud   Commands related to Hasura Cloud Ops
  cli     Hasura CLI ops
  plugin  Commands related to CLI Plugins [aliases: plugins]
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --log-level <log-level>  The log level to be printed in stdout [env: HASURA_CLI_LOG_LEVEL=] [possible values: error, warn, info, debug, trace, error-all, warn-all, info-all,
                               debug-all, trace-all]
  -h, --help                   Print help
  -V, --version                Print version

```

:::info Set the version of the CLI

You can set the version of the CLI by setting the `HASURA_CLI_CALVER` env var before running `just install`. Hasura CLI
uses [CalVer](https://calver.org/).
