# Hasura CI/CD

In this section, we will explore the Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) features of Hasura V3. These features are designed to streamline your development workflows, enable rapid iteration, and ensure smooth deployments of your Hasura projects.

## Sub-Second CI/CD for APIs
Hasura V3 introduces a new approach to CI/CD that enables sub-second deployments for your APIs. With this new workflow, you can iterate and test your changes quickly, reducing the time between development and production.

## Builds and Independent Testing
In Hasura V3, every metadata state represents a build. Each build can be independently tested to ensure its correctness and compatibility with your project. This separation of builds allows you to validate and verify changes before applying them to your production environment.

## No Metadata Migrations
Unlike previous versions, Hasura V3 eliminates the need for metadata migrations. With the new CI/CD workflow, you can apply metadata builds directly to your project without the hassle of managing migrations. This simplifies the deployment process and reduces the chances of errors or conflicts.

## In-Product Metadata Version Control
Hasura V3 introduces in-product metadata version control, allowing you to track and manage changes to your metadata over time. Each build is associated with a unique build ID, making it easier to identify and roll back changes if needed. This version control feature provides better visibility and control over your API configurations.

## Rapid Testing and Deployment
With the sub-second CI/CD capabilities of Hasura V3, you can rapidly test and deploy multiple iterations of your API in a single day, or even within an hour. This level of agility empowers you to iterate quickly, gather feedback, and make improvements to your APIs without sacrificing stability or reliability.

## Zero Downtime Rollouts
Hasura V3 enables zero downtime rollouts, allowing you to deploy changes to your APIs without disrupting the availability of your services. This ensures a seamless experience for your end-users and minimizes any potential impact during the deployment process.
