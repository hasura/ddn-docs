# Hasura CI/CD

Hasura v3 introduces a range of CI/CD features that significantly streamline the development, testing, and deployment of
APIs. These features are designed to enhance the iteration process and reduce downtime during updates.

Some features we you can look forward to include:

- Sub-Second CI/CD
- Builds and Project Shares
- Zero Downtime Rollouts
- Rapid Testing and Deployments
- CLI-Controlled Deployments
- Enhanced Metadata Version Control

We'll have more content here soon. For now, check out the CLI install instructions to see how to get started with CI/CD
by creating local projects and easily deploy them to Hasura Cloud:
