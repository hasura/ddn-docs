# Collaborators

## Introduction

Any Hasura DDN user can create a project and share it with other users. This allows you to collaborate with other users
by giving them access to your project's metadata and builds. A collaborator can also access the project in the Console
to view metrics, test the API, and more.

## Collaborator lifecycle

### Create

A collaborator can be invited from the Console. In `Settings` > `Governance` > `Collaborators`, choose
`+ Invite a collaborator`:

Then, enter their email address and choose which role to assign them:

### Manage

Currently, collaborators can only be added or deleted from a project. If you wish to change the access level for a user,
simply delete them and re-add them with the new role.

| Role                            | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin                           | Admins have full access to the project meaning that they can create and edit metadata; create and apply builds.                        |
| Read Metadata & Explore GraphQL | Collaborators with this role can view the project's metadata and explore the GraphQL API, but they cannot make changes to the project. |

:::info Project owners

Please note, only project owners can delete a project. Ownership transfer is planned for a future release.

### Delete

You can remove a collaborator from the Console by selecting `Remove` next to a user's name:
