# Subgraphs

## Introduction

For a multi-team organization working on a Hasura project, it can make sense for any one team to not have access to all
metadata objects. Subgraphs introduces the notion of a module system for your Hasura metadata.

A project can have a collection of subgraphs and the project becomes the 'union' of metadata objects across all
subgraphs of the project. Each subgraph can then be accessed and updated independently.

A manifest file with subgraphs looks something like the following:

```yaml
kind: SupergraphManifest
version: v1
definition:
  name: base
  envfile: base.env.yaml
  #highlight-start
  subgraphs:
    - app
    - chinook
  #highlight-end
```

## Subgraph Lifecycle

### Create

You can create a subgraph for a project on Hasura DDN using the CLI:

```bash
ddn create subgraph
```

This will launch a wizard allowing you to create and configure your subgraph. You'll so need to create a connector
manifest locally in the subgraph's metadata directory. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
ddn add connector-manifest <NAME_FOR_CONNECTOR> --subgraph <SUBGRAPH_NAME_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP>
```

### Manage

You can easily list all the available subgraphs for a project using the CLI:

```bash
ddn get subgraph
```

You can connect new data sources, add new types, etc. to a subgraph. Any files you add to the subgraph directory will be
picked up by the metadata build and associated with the subgraph.

### Delete

Delete a subgraph by running:

```bash
ddn delete subgraph <SUBGRAPH_NAME>
```
