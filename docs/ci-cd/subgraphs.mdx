# Subgraphs

## Introduction

For a multi-team organization working on a Hasura project, it can make sense for any one team to not have access to all
metadata objects. Subgraphs introduces the notion of a module system for your Hasura metadata.

A project can have a collection of subgraphs and the project becomes the 'union' of metadata objects across all
subgraphs of the project. Each subgraph can then be accessed and updated independently.

A manifest file with subgraphs looks something like the following:

```yaml
kind: SupergraphManifest
version: v1
definition:
  environment: dev
  name: base
  mode: replace
  envfile: base.env.yaml
  supergraph:
    resources:
      - supergraph/**/*.hml
  # highlight-start
  subgraphs:
    - name: app
      resources:
        - app/**/*.hml
      connectors:
        app_connector:
          path: app/app_connector
          manifestFile: app_connector.build.hml
        app_functions:
          path: app/app_functions
          manifestFile: app_functions.build.hml
    - name: user_experience
      resources:
        - user_experience/**/*.hml
      connectors:
        user_experience_connector:
          path: user_experience/user_experience_connector
          manifestFile: user_experience_connector.build.hml
  # highlight-end
```

## Subgraph Lifecycle

### Create

You can create a subgraph for a project on Hasura DDN using the CLI:

```bash
ddn create subgraph <SUBGRAPH_NAME>
```

This will create the subgraph on Hasura DDN, but you'll need to add a connector manifest to create the local subgraph
directory. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
ddn add connector-manifest <NAME_FOR_CONNECTOR> --subgraph <SUBGRAPH_NAME_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP> --hub-connector <NAME_OF_CONNECTOR> --type <LOCAL_OR_CLOUD>
```

### Manage

You can easily list all the available subgraphs for a project using the CLI:

```bash
ddn get subgraph
```

You can connect new data sources, add new types, etc. to a subgraph. Any files you add to the subgraph directory will be
picked up by the metadata build and associated with the subgraph.

### Delete

Delete a subgraph by running:

```bash
ddn delete subgraph <SUBGRAPH_NAME>
```
