# Secure Connect

## Introduction

Hasura provides a secure way to tunnel a local database to Hasura DDN. This allows you to use your local database for
development while experiencing the full power of Hasura DDN.

:::tip Prerequisites

- The [new Hasura CLI](/ci-cd/hasura-cli.mdx)
- A locally running [PostgreSQL database](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

:::

## Step 1: Start your database

Start your local database. For example, if you are using Docker, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name <DATABASE_NAME> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASSWORD> -p 5432:5432 <DATABASE_IMAGE>
```

## Step 2: Start the daemon

Start the Hasura daemon with the `daemon start` command:

```bash
hasura3 local daemon start
```

The daemon will block this window while it runs.

## Step 3: Create a secure connect tunnel

Open a new tab or window for your terminal and run the `create` command:

```bash
hasura3 cloud tunnel create <SOCKET>
```

The `<SOCKET>` argument is the address of your local database. For example, if you are running a local PostgreSQL
database on the default port, you would use `localhost:5432`.

The CLI will return a URL that you can use to connect to your database. You should use this URL to form a connection
string for your database, like this:

```text
postgresql://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<URL_RETURNED_BY_THE_CLI>/<DATABASE_NAME>
```

## Step 4: Connect to your database

Head to the [Console](https://console.hasura.io) and
[create a new project](/getting-started/console.mdx#step-3-connect-a-data-source). When you are prompted to connect to a
database, use the connection string you created in the previous step.

And, viola ðŸŽ‰ You can now interact with your local database directly from Hasura DDN!
