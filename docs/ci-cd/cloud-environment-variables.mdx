# Cloud Environment Variables

## Introduction

Environment variables are a means of storing sensitive information as key-value pairs that you don't want exposed in
your metadata. This could be anything from a database password to an API key.

:::info Accessing environment variables

Environment variables are stored in Hasura DDN and can be accessed by a single environment from a single
[project](/ci-cd/projects.mdx).

## Environment variables lifecycle

### Set

To create — or **set** — an environment variable, you'll first need a [**project**](/ci-cd/projects.mdx) on Hasura DDN.
Then, create the variable using the CLI:

```bash
ddn create cloud-environment-variable <key> <value> --environment <env-name>
```

### Use

You can then use the key in your metadata — notably your `base.env.yaml` file — to reference the value of the
environment:

```yaml
supergraph: {}
subgraphs:
  app:
    APP_APP_CONNECTOR_CONNECTION_URI: <STRING_VALUE>
    APP_APP_CONNECTOR_CONNECTOR_URI: <STRING_VALUE>
```

### Delete

You can delete a environment variable using the following command:

```bash
ddn delete cloud-environment-variable <key> --environment <env-name>
```
