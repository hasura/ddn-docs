# Secrets

## Introduction

Secrets are a means of storing sensitive information as key-value pairs that you don't want exposed in your
`metadata.hml` file. This could be anything from a database password to an API key.

Secrets are stored in Hasura DDN and can be accessed by a single [project](/ci-cd/projects.mdx).

## Secrets lifecycle

### Set

To create — or **set** — a secret, you'll first need a [**project**](/ci-cd/projects.mdx) on Hasura DDN. Then, create
the secret using the CLI:

```bash
hasura3 cloud secret set --project-id <PROJECT_ID> <KEY>=<VALUE>
```

### Use

You can then use the key in your `metadata.hml` file:

```yaml
connection_uris:
  - <KEY>
```

### Delete

You can delete a secret using the following command:

```bash
hasura3 cloud secret delete --project-id <PROJECT_ID> <KEY>
```
