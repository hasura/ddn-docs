# Projects

## Introduction

Broadly, a project is a data supergraph that is managed by Hasura DDN.

The supergraph acts as the API and underlying configuration that serves [**builds**](/ci-cd/builds.mdx), which are
snapshots of your project's configuration at some point in time. A project can contain many builds, but only one
build will serve as the project's **active** or applied build.

## Initialize a Project

We can create a new project and link it to its twin on Hasura DDN by using the Hasura CLI to create a new project.

### Get a Personal Access Token (PAT)

In order to link local and Hasura DDN projects we will need a Personal Access Token (PAT) and use it to login to
Hasura DDN with the Hasura CLI.

You can create a PAT by navigating to the [Access Tokens page](https://cloud.hasura.io/account-settings/access-tokens)
in your account settings. Where you can create a new token and copy the value.

Back in the Hasura CLI, run:

```bash
hasura3 login --pat <PAT>
```

You should see a confirmation that you're now successfully logged in, and can now create a new project and
simultaneously link it to its twin on Hasura DDN.

### Create a new project

```bash
hasura3 init --dir .
```

You will be presented with the following options:

```
Create a new project
From an existing project
Empty project
```

Choose `Create a new project`.

## Project configuration

The previous command will create a project on Hasura DDN and local files in a directory structure which will be used to
manage your project:

```
ðŸ“‚.
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ subgraphs
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ default
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ commands
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ dataconnectors
â”‚     â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ models
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ supergraph
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ auth-config.hml
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ compatibility-config.hml
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ build-profile.yaml
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ hasura.yaml
```

:::info .gitkeep

You will find empty .gitkeep files in some directories which are used to preserve empty directories in Git.

:::

### hasura.yaml

This is the entrypoint to a local Hasura project. This specifies the project name and lists the build-profile files
as well as a default build profile to use if one is not specified when running a CLI command. By having
logged in and specifying the project name in the hasura.yaml file, the CLI will know which project to use when
running commands in this directory.

### Build profiles

Build profile files define a build `environment` and where to obtain the `subgraph` and `supergraph` metadata for it.
The `build-profile.yaml` file is created by the CLI to get you started.

You can create additional build profile files for different environments you may need eg: `staging`, `production`, etc.

Each build profile file must be referenced by the `hasura.yaml` file in order to be used.

### Supergraphs

The supergraph defines the `auth` and `compatibility` configurations for the project and is referenced by a build
profile.

### Subgraphs

You will divide your project into one or more separate subgraphs which are referenced by a build profile.

The `default` subgraph is required and cannot be deleted.

Subgraphs can be used to group together objects in your metadata in a way that makes sense for you and your
team. Multiple `hml` files can belong to a subgraph, and you can have multiple subgraphs in a project.

All `hml` files will conform to the [OpenDD Spec](/data-domain-modeling/overview.mdx).

The CLI populates the `default` subgraph with `command`, `dataconnectors`, and `model` directories, but the
organization of these is customizable by you and your team.

## VS Code Extension

The [Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura&ssr=false#review-details)
is there to help you author and edit `hml` files in your subgraphs. It provides syntax highlighting, validation, and
autocompletion.

## Builds

In order to see configurations in your metadata take effect you need to create a build. Head over to
the [Builds](/ci-cd/builds.mdx) section to learn about how to create and manage builds.

## Project Describe

You can get the relevant information of your project by using the CLI and running:

```bash
hasura3 project describe
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

```bash
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Name        | master-shrimp-9462                                           |

+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Console URL | https://console.hasura.io/project/master-shrimp-9462/graphql |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Build Count | 1                                                            |

+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Projects List

You can list all the projects you have access to by running:

```bash
hasura3 project list
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

```bash
+-------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| CREATED AT  |         NAME          |                  ID                  |                           CONSOLE URL                           |
+-------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| 27 Nov 2023 | master-shrimp-9462    | fa2f39db-247d-4820-83c4-96cec5e6bd38 | https://console.hasura.io/project/master-shrimp-9462/graphql    |
+-------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

```

### Delete

You can delete a project using the CLI by running:

```bash
hasura3 project delete
```
