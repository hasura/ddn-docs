# Projects

## Introduction

Broadly, a project is a data supergraph that is managed by Hasura DDN.

This supergraph acts as the API and underlying configuration that serves [**builds**](/ci-cd/builds.mdx), which are
snapshots of your `metadata.hml` file. A project can contain many builds, but only one build will serve as the project's
**active** build.

Locally, any directory that contains a `metadata.hml` file is considered a project. This file describes your supergraph
and is used to generate the API and configuration for your project. You can use the Hasura CLI to generate this file and
create builds for a particular project.

## Project lifecycle

### Create

#### Locally

Running the following command will create an empty `metadata.hml` file in the current directory:

```bash
hasura3 local init --dir  .
```

You can then use the
[Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura&ssr=false#review-details)
to scaffold out and populate your `metadata.hml` file.

#### DDN

This local `metadata.hml` file, when properly configured, can be used to generate a build for your project on Hasura
DDN. However, you'll first need a new project on DDN to associate your build with. You can achieve this by running:

```bash
hasura3 cloud project create
```

The CLI wil return information about your new project:

```text
 Creating project... ok
 Name         <PROJECT_NAME>
 ID           <PROJECT_ID>
 Console URL  https://console.hasura.io/project/<PROJECT_ID>/graphql
```

### Manage

You can manage your project from the Console endpoint returned by the CLI when creating a new project:

```text
https://console.hasura.io/project/<PROJECT_ID>/graphql
```

From the Console, you can view your project's builds, analyze metrics, test your API using GraphiQL, and more.

### Delete

You can delete a project from the Console by navigating to the following link for your project:

```text
https://console.hasura.io/project/<PROJECT_ID>/settings/summary/project
```
