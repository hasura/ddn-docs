# Projects

## Introduction

Broadly, a project is the configuration of your data supergraph.

A project specifies manifests, each of which specify supergraph and subgraph configurations that are used create
[builds](/ci-cd/builds.mdx) which are snapshots of the project config and are used to serve your API.

## Initialize a Project

We can create a new project on Hasura DDN and scaffold out the metadata locally using the Hasura CLI.

### Login to Hasura DDN

In order to create a project, you need to be logged into Hasura DDN. You can do this in two ways:

- Via the browser (recommended)
- Using a Personal Access Token (PAT)

#### Browser

```bash
ddn login
```

This will launch a browser window and prompt you to login to your Hasura DDN account. Once you've logged in, you can
close the browser window and return to your terminal.

#### PAT

Alternatively, you can use a PAT to authenticate with the CLI.

You can create a PAT by navigating to the [Access Tokens page](https://cloud.hasura.io/account-settings/access-tokens)
in your account settings. Where you can create a new token and copy the value.

Back in the Hasura CLI, run:

```bash
ddn login --pat <PAT>
```

You should see a confirmation that you're now successfully logged in, and can now create a new project.

### Create a new project

```bash
ddn create project --dir ./<DIR>
```

### Configure a project

This will create a new project on Hasura DDN and scaffold out the necessary configuration files in the directory you
specified.

For more information on the project configuration files, see the [configuration section](/ci-cd/config.mdx).

#### Create builds

In order to see configurations in your metadata take effect you need to create a build. Head over to the
[Builds](/ci-cd/builds.mdx) section to learn about how to create and manage builds.

Alternatively, during development, you can use [dev mode](/cli/commands/dev.mdx) to automatically create builds when
changes are detected in your project.

#### Get a project

You can get the relevant information of your project in the current directory by using the CLI and running:

```bash
ddn get project
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

```text
+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Name        | stunning-eagle-6335                                            |

+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

:::info Running from a non-project directory

If you've installed the CLI globally and are running the command from a directory that is not a project directory, you
will see all the projects you have access to.

:::

### Delete a project {#delete}

You can delete a project using the CLI by running:

```bash
ddn project delete
```
