# Projects

## Introduction

Broadly, a project is the configuration of your data supergraph.

A project specifies build profiles, each of which specify supergraph and subgraph configurations that are used create
[builds](/ci-cd/builds.mdx) which are snapshots of the project config and are used to serve your API.

## Initialize a Project

We can create a new project and link it to its twin on Hasura DDN by using the Hasura CLI to create a new project.

### Get a Personal Access Token (PAT)

In order to link local and Hasura DDN projects we will need a Personal Access Token (PAT) and use it to log in to Hasura
DDN with the Hasura CLI.

You can create a PAT by navigating to the [Access Tokens page](https://cloud.hasura.io/account-settings/access-tokens)
in your account settings. Where you can create a new token and copy the value.

Back in the Hasura CLI, run:

```bash
hasura3 login --pat <PAT>
```

You should see a confirmation that you're now successfully logged in, and can now create a new project and
simultaneously link it to its twin on Hasura DDN.

### Create a new project

```bash
hasura3 init --dir .
```

You will be presented with the following options:

```
Create a new project
Empty project
```

Choose `Create a new project`.

### Configure a project

The previous command will create a project on Hasura DDN and local files in a directory structure which will be used to
manage your project.

For more information on the project configuration files, see the [configuration section](/ci-cd/config.mdx).

:::info Running CLI commands without specifying a project name each time

By logging into Hasura DDN via the CLI and specifying the project name in the hasura.yaml file, the CLI will know which
project to use when running commands in the directory.

#### VS Code Extension

The
[Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura&ssr=false#review-details)
is there to help you author and edit `hml` files in your subgraphs. It provides syntax highlighting, validation, and
autocompletion.

#### Create builds

In order to see configurations in your metadata take effect you need to create a build. Head over to the
[Builds](/ci-cd/builds.mdx) section to learn about how to create and manage builds.

#### Describe a project

You can get the relevant information of your project by using the CLI and running:

```bash
hasura3 project describe
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

```text

You can list all the projects you have access to by running:

```bash
hasura3 project list
```

You will see an output similar to the following:
