# Configuration

## Introduction

Hasura v3 introduces a new configuration model for projects on the Hasura Data Delivery Network (DDN). This model relies
on four types of files:

| File type           | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hasura.yaml`       | The main configuration file.                                                       |
| `.local.yaml`       | A file that stores environment variables and pertinent information for connectors. |
| `*.supergraph.yaml` | Build manifests for a project.                                                     |
| `*.hml`             | Hasura metadata files for a project.                                               |

### hasura.yaml

This is the entry point to a Hasura project.

```yaml
version: 1
project: <PROJECT_NAME>

supergraphManifests:
  - base.supergraph.hml

defaultSupergraphManifest: base.supergraph.hml
```

The `version` section is used to specify the version of the configuration file. The `project` field is used to specify
the project name.

The `hasura.yaml` file also contains a `supergraphManifests` section. This section is used to specify the various
manifest files associated with the project. As you can see from this example, we only have one manifest,
`base.supergraph.hml` which is also identified as the default to use when creating a new build. **The `base` profile is
required for a project.**

### .local.yaml

This file is used to store environment variables and pertinent information for connectors. Ideally, the CLI will handle
this file for you, but you can also manually edit it if you need to.

### Supergraph manifests

Supergraph manifests tell Hasura DDN how to construct your supergraph. A manifest will contain information such as which
environment to use, which subgraphs to include, and which resources to use for the build.

By default, the included `base.supergraph.hml` file is populated with the following content:

```yaml
kind: SupergraphManifest
version: v1
definition:
  environment: dev
  name: base
  mode: replace
  envfile: .local.yaml
  supergraph:
    resources:
      - supergraph/**/*.hml
  subgraphs:
    - name: app
      resources:
        - app/**/*.hml
      connectors:
        app_connector:
          path: app/app_connector
          manifestFile: app_connector.build.hml
```

Here, you can see that the `base.supergraph.hml` file contains a `definition` section with the following fields:

| Field         | Description                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `environment` | The environment to use for the build.       |
| `name`        | The name of the manifest.                   |
| `mode`        | The mode to use for the build.              |
| `envfile`     | The file to use for environment variables.  |
| `supergraph`  | The resources to use for the supergraph.    |
| `subgraphs`   | The subgraphs to include in the supergraph. |

### Supergraph

The `supergraph` directory contains the supergraph configuration files. The three included files are:

```bash
├── auth-config.hml
├── compatibility-config.hml
└── graphql-config.hml
```

Each of these files' contents are used to configure the supergraph.

The `auth-config.hml` file contains the authentication configuration for the supergraph, allowing you to utilize either
JWTs or webhooks.

The `compatibility-config.hml` file contains the compatibility configuration — using a version number — for the
supergraph.

The `graphql-config.hml` file contains the GraphQL configuration for the supergraph, which allows you to customize the
available query and mutation capabilities along with the schema.

### Subgraphs

Each subgraph is listed as a top-level directory in the root of the project. The CLI will init your project with an
`app` subgraph.

Each subgraph directory will contain the following folder structure when a new connector manifest is added for the
directory:

```bash
└── <CONNECTOR_NAME>
    ├── builds
    │   ├── configuration.json
    │   ├── schema.json
    │   └── <CONNECTOR_NAME>.build.hml
    └── <CONNECTOR_NAME>.hml
```

| File/Folder                  | Description                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `builds`                     | The directory containing the build artifacts for the connector.                    |
| `/builds/configuration.json` | The configuration file for the connector.                                          |
| `/builds/schema.json`        | The schema file for the connector.                                                 |
| `<CONNECTOR_NAME>.build.hml` | The build manifest for the connector.                                              |
| `<CONNECTOR_NAME>.hml`       | The metadata file for the connector based on the introspection of the data source. |

## Basic configuration

When using the [ddn CLI](/cli/overview.mdx) to create a new project, you'll run the following command:

```bash
ddn quickstart
```

After completing the wizard — if using the default values — this will generate a new project directory in the current
folder with the following structure:

```bash
<PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
├── app
│   └── app_connector
│       ├── app_connector.hml
│       └── builds
│           ├── app_connector.build.hml
│           ├── configuration.json
│           └── schema.json
├── base.supergraph.hml
├── hasura.yaml
└── supergraph
    ├── auth-config.hml
    ├── compatibility-config.hml
    └── graphql-config.hml
```
