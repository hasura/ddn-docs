# Configuration

## Introduction

Hasura v3 introduces new configuration for projects on the Hasura Data Delivery Network (DDN). This config relies on
four types of files:

| File type                                    | Description                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`hasura.yaml`](#hasurayaml)                 | The main configuration file.                                                                                               |
| [`*.env.yaml`](#envyaml)                     | A file that stores environment variables and pertinent information for connectors and a supergraph manifest.               |
| [`*.supergraph.yaml`](#supergraph-manifests) | Build manifest file(s) for a project.                                                                                      |
| `*.hml`                                      | Hasura metadata files for a project.                                                                                       |
| [`<SUBGRAPH_DIRECTORY>`](#subgraphs)         | A directory, containing all the necessary configuration and metadata files, for a corresponding subgraph within a project. |

### hasura.yaml

This is the entrypoint to a Hasura project.

```yaml
version: v1
project: <PROJECT_NAME>

supergraphManifests:
  rootPath: "."
  resources:
    - "/*.hml"

defaultSupergraphManifest: base
```

The `version` section is used to specify the version of the configuration file. The `project` field is used to specify
the project name.

The `hasura.yaml` file also contains a `supergraphManifests` section. This section is used to specify the various
[manifest files](#supergraph-manifests) associated with the project. As you can see from this example, `base` is
intended to use all nested `hml` files as resources in a build and is also identified as the default to use when
creating a new build. **The `base` profile is required for a project.**

### \*.env.yaml

This file is used to store environment variables and pertinent information for connectors. The CLI will handle this file
for you, but you can also manually edit it if you need to. The CLI generates a `base.env.yaml` for you by default.

### Supergraph manifests {#supergraph-manifests}

Supergraph manifests tell Hasura DDN how to construct your supergraph. A manifest will contain information such as which
environment to use, which subgraphs to include, and which resources to use for the build.

By default, the included `base.supergraph.hml` file is populated with the following content and specifies a `dev`
[environment](/ci-cd/environments.mdx):

```yaml
kind: SupergraphManifest
version: v1
definition:
  name: base
  environment: dev
  envfile: base.env.yaml
  supergraph:
    rootPath: supergraph
    resources:
      - "*.hml"
  subgraphs:
    - name: app
      rootPath: app
      resources:
        - "*.hml"
        - "!app_connector/connector/*"
        - app_connector/connector/app_connector.build.hml
```

### Supergraph

The `supergraph` directory contains the supergraph configuration files. The three included files are:

```bash
├── auth-config.hml
├── compatibility-config.hml
└── graphql-config.hml
```

:::info Organizing files

The contents of these files include the necessary metadata objects to build your supergraph. We've separated them out
into files organized by their purpose, but you can organize them anyway you like so long as the metadata objects within
them are all included.

:::

Each of these files' contents are used to configure the supergraph.

The `auth-config.hml` file contains the authentication configuration for the supergraph, allowing you to utilize either
JWTs or webhooks.

The `compatibility-config.hml` file contains the compatibility configuration — using a version number — for the
supergraph.

The `graphql-config.hml` file contains the GraphQL configuration for the supergraph, which allows you to customize the
available query and mutation capabilities along with the schema.

### Subgraphs

Each subgraph is listed as a top-level directory in the root of the project. The CLI will init your project with an
`app` subgraph.

Each subgraph directory will contain the following folder structure when a new connector manifest is added for the
subgraph:

```bash
└── <CONNECTOR_NAME>
│   ├── <CONNECTOR_NAME>-types.hml
│   ├── <CONNECTOR_NAME>.hml
│   ├── connector
│   │   ├── <CONNECTOR_NAME>.build.hml
│   │   ├── configuration.json
│   │   └── schema.json
│   └── models
```

| File/Folder                             | Description                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<CONNECTOR_NAME>`                      | The directory containing the build artifacts for the connector.                    |
| `<CONNECTOR_NAME>-types.html`           | The metadata file for the connector's types.                                       |
| `<CONNECTOR_NAME>.hml`                  | The metadata file for the connector based on the introspection of the data source. |
| `<CONNECTOR_NAME>/configuration.json`   | The configuration file for the connector.                                          |
| `<CONNECTOR_NAME>/schema.json`          | The schema file for the connector.                                                 |
| `/connector/<CONNECTOR_NAME>.build.hml` | The build manifest for the connector.                                              |

## Basic configuration

When using the [ddn CLI](/cli/overview.mdx) to create a new project, you'll run the following command:

```bash
ddn quickstart
```

After completing the wizard — if using the default values — this will generate a new project directory in the current
folder with the following structure:

```bash
<PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
├── app_connector
│   ├── app_connector-types.hml
│   ├── app_connector.hml
│   ├── connector
│   │   ├── app_connector.build.hml
│   │   ├── configuration.json
│   │   └── schema.json
```
