# Configuration

## Introduction

Hasura v3 introduces a new configuration model for projects on the Hasura Data Delivery Network (DDN). This model relies
on three types of files:

| File type              | Description                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `hasura.yaml`          | The main configuration file.                                |
| `build-profile-*.yaml` | Build profiles for a project.                               |
| `*.hml`                | Hasura metadata files for a project.                        |

### hasura.yaml

This is the entry point to a Hasura project.

```yaml
version: 1
project: <PROJECT_NAME>
buildProfiles:
  - build-profile.yaml
defaultBuildProfile: build-profile.yaml
```

The `version` section is used to specify the version of the configuration file. The `project` field is used to
specify the project name.

The `hasura.yaml` file also contains a `buildProfiles` section. This section is used to specify the build profile files
associated with the project. As you can see from this example, we only have one build profile, `build-profile.yaml`
which is also identified as the default to use when creating a new build. **The `default` profile is required for a
project.**

### Build profiles

By default, the included `build-profile.yaml` file is populated with the following content:

```yaml
version: 2
spec:
  environment: default
  mode: replace
  supergraph:
    resources:
      - supergraph/*
  subgraphs:
    - name: default
      resources:
        - "subgraphs/default/**/*.hml"
```

Here, you can see that the `build-profile.yaml` file contains `version` and `spec` sections. The `version` section is
used to specify the version of the configuration file.

The `spec` section contains the following fields:

| Field         | Description                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `environment` | The environment to use for the build.                      |
| `mode`        | The mode to use for the build. `Replace` by default.       |
| `supergraph`  | The supergraph resources to use for the build.             |
| `subgraph`    | List of subgraphs and their resources to use for the build |

You can create additional build profile files for different environments you may need e.g., `staging`, `production`,
etc. By combining build profiles which specify environments with version control, you can easily set up an effective
CI/CD pipeline for your project.

Each build profile file must be referenced by the `hasura.yaml` file in order to be used.

### Supergraph

Your `supergraph` directory will contain two configuration files by default: the `auth-config.hml` and
`compatibility-config.hml` files.

The `auth-config.hml` file defines the authentication configuration for your supergraph i.e., the configuration for
how the queries to your Hasura DDN project should be authenticated. The `compatibility-config.hml` file defines the
compatibility date of your supergraph metadata. You'd likely not want to change the compatibility config unless
you're sure about it.

#### AuthConfig

```yaml
kind: AuthConfig
version: v1
definition:
  allowRoleEmulationBy: admin
  mode:
    webhook:
      method: Post
      url: https://auth.pro.hasura.io/webhook/ddn?role=admin
```

The `AuthConfig` object is used to configure authentication for your data supergraph. You can learn more about
authentication in the [Auth section](/auth/overview.mdx).

#### CompatibilityConfig

```yaml
kind: CompatibilityConfig
date: 2023-10-19
```

The `CompatibilityConfig` object is used to configure compatibility for your data supergraph.

### Subgraphs

Inside the `subgraphs` directory, each subgraph is identified by a directory with the name of the subgraph. Within
that, we have included three directories to get you started:

```bash
└── <SUBGRAPH_NAME>
│       ├── commands
│       ├── dataconnectors
│       └── models
```

A project is divided into one or more separate subgraphs which are referenced by a build profile.

The `default` subgraph is required and cannot be deleted.

Subgraphs can be used to group together objects in your metadata in a way that makes sense for you and your
team. Multiple `hml` files can belong to a subgraph, and you can have multiple subgraphs in a project. Objects in
each hml file must conform to the [OpenDD Spec](/data-domain-modeling/overview.mdx) and
[subgraph rules](./subgraphs.mdx).

The CLI populates the `default` subgraph with `command`, `dataconnectors`, and `model` directories, but the
organization of these is completely customizable by you and your team.

:::info What is HML?

These are both `hml` files, which is a new file format for Hasura metadata. It is a superset of the existing `yaml`
format, and is designed to provide a more flexible and extensible way to define metadata. You can leverage the power of
the [Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) to quickly and
easily author `hml` files.

:::

Your `hml` files contain metadata objects according to the OpenDD spec. In the example above, we could add a
`HasuraHubDataConnector` object to connect to a data source. Then, import our tables as models and create a build on
Hasura DDN.

However, in the next section, we'll look at how to use subgraphs to organize metadata and break up our `hml` file into
smaller, more governable pieces.

## Basic configuration

When using the [hasura3 CLI](/cli/overview.mdx) to create a new project, you'll run the following command:

```bash
hasura3 init --dir .
```

This will generate a new project directory in the current folder with the following structure:

```bash
<PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
├── build-profile.yaml
├── hasura.yaml
├── subgraphs
│   └── default
│       ├── commands
│       ├── dataconnectors
│       └── models
└── supergraph
    ├── auth-config.hml
    └── compatibility-config.hml
```

:::info .gitkeep

You will find empty .gitkeep files in some directories which are used to preserve empty directories in Git.

:::

## Advanced configuration

Let's consider a data supergraph wherein you'd like to test your API across multiple
[environments](/ci-cd/environments.mdx). We can use subgraphs to organize our metadata and break up our `hml` file into
smaller, more governable pieces. We can also utilize build profiles to create different builds for different
environments.

Imagine this file structure:

```bash
<PROJECT_NAME>
├── build-profile.yaml
├── build-profile-staging.yaml
├── hasura.yaml
├── subgraphs
│   └── app
│       ├── commands
│       ├── dataconnectors
│           └── app.hml
│       └── models
│           ├── cart_items.hml
│           ├── carts.hml
│           ├── categories.hml
│           ├── coupons.hml
│           ├── manufactuers.hml
│           ├── notifications.hml
│           ├── orders.hml
│           ├── products.hml
│           ├── reviews.hml
│           └── users.hml
└── supergraph
    ├── auth-config.hml
    └── compatibility-config.hml
```

### Build profiles

In this example, we have two build profiles: `build-profile.yaml` and `build-profile-staging.yaml`. The
`build-profile.yaml` file contains the following content:

```yaml
version: 2
spec:
  # highlight-start
  environment: default
  # highlight-end
  mode: replace
  supergraph:
    resources:
      - supergraph/*
  subgraphs:
    - name: app
      resources:
        - "subgraphs/**/*.hml"
```

Whereas the `build-profile-staging.yaml` file contains the following content:

```yaml
version: 2
spec:
  # highlight-start
  environment: staging
  # highlight-end
  mode: replace
  supergraph:
    resources:
      - supergraph/*
  subgraphs:
    - name: app
      resources:
        - "subgraphs/**/*.hml"
```

The two build profiles, `build-profile.yaml` and `build-profile-staging.yaml`, are designed to cater to different
environments. The `build-profile.yaml` is configured for the default environment and is set to include all subgraphs in
the subgraphs directory. This configuration is suitable for a general development team working on various parts of the
project.

As this is the default build profile, it will be used when you run the following command:

```bash
hasura3 build create
```

On the other hand, `build-profile-staging.yaml` is specifically configured for the staging environment and is intended
for testing with other staging services.

You can create a build with this profile by running the following command:

```bash
hasura3 build create --profile build-profile-staging.yaml
```

### hasura.yaml

The `hasura.yaml` in the root of the project contains the following content:

```yaml
version: 1
project: <PROJECT_NAME>
buildProfiles:
  - ./build-profile.yaml
  - ./build-profile-staging.yaml
defaultBuildProfile: build-profile.yaml
```

This lets Hasura DDN know that we have two build profiles, and that the `build-profile.yaml` is the default to use when
creating a new build.

### Custom Directory Structure

You could choose to deviate from the default directory structure that the Hasura project initializes for you into
one that suits you and your team's needs.

For example, you could have a single file with all the metadata objects, including your `HasuraHubDataConnector`
objects, models, and commands, as long as you specify that file to be in your subgraph resources in the build
profile. However, this would be difficult to manage and maintain.

You could also choose to arrange your subgraphs by data type. E.g., `subgraphs/default/users`,
`subgraphs/defaultproducts`, etc.

The contents of the `hml` files can be that of any valid OpenDD metadata object as long as they conform to the rules
of [subgraphs](./subgraphs.mdx).
