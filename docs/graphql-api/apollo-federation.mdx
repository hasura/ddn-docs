## Introduction
Hasura DDN can be used as a subgraph in a supergraph built using [Apollo
Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/). Apollo Federation is a way to compose multiple GraphQL
services (called subgraphs) into a unified API (called supergraph).

:::info Let's learn about some terms used by Hasura as well as Apollo

Some of the terms used in Apollo Federation conflict with the terms used in Hasura. Here is a quick glossary to help you understand the terms better:

| Term       | Hasura                                                                                             | Apollo Federation                                                                                               |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Subgraph   | A subgraph in Hasura is a notion of a module system for Hasura metadata.                           | A subgraph in Apollo Federation is a standalone GraphQL service.                                                |
| Supergraph | A supergraph in Hasura is the GraphQL API that is created by combining multiple subgraph metadata. | A supergraph in Apollo Federation is a unified GraphQL API that is created by stitching multiple subgraph APIs. |

## Using DDN as a subgraph

DDN is [Apollo Federation subgraph specification](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/subgraph-spec/)
compliant, so you can plug Hasura DDN as a subgraph in your Apollo federated supergraph.


```mermaid
graph LR;
  clients(Clients);
  router([Apollo Supergraph <br/>Router]);
  serviceA[GraphQL API <br/>Subgraph A];
  serviceB[Hasura DDN <br/>Subgraph B];
  router --- serviceA & serviceB;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;

```

## Enabling Apollo Federation fields in metadata

You will need to edit the [`GraphqlConfig`](/supergraph-modeling/graphql-config/#graphqlconfig-graphqlconfig) for the
supergraph to enable the fields required for schema stitching by the Apollo supergraph router. You will have to add the
following in the `definition` for `GraphqlConfig` (usually in `supergraph/graphql-config.hml` file):

```yaml
apolloFederation:
  enableRootFields: true
```

An example of the `graphql-config.hml` file with apollo federation fields enabled:

```yaml {8-9}
kind: GraphqlConfig
version: v1
definition:
  query:
    rootOperationTypeName: Query
  mutation:
    rootOperationTypeName: Mutation
  apolloFederation:
    enableRootFields: true
```

## Marking Type as Apollo Entity

Types defined in Hasura DDN can also be marked as [Entities](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/entities/).
This will allow the same type to be resolved from DDN (and your other subgraphs that defines the type) as well.

To mark a type as an entity, you will have to edit the metadata for the `ObjectType` and the `Model` which will be
used to resolve the type.

1. You will have to add the keys for the `ObjectType`. The
   [keys](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/entities/#1-define-a-key) can be defined as following in the
   [`definition.graphql`](/supergraph-modeling/types#objecttype-objecttypegraphqlconfiguration) for `ObjectType`:

   ```yaml
   apolloFederation:
     keys: # The fields that uniquely identifies the entity
       - fields:
         - id
   ```

2. You will have to mark the Model that should act as the source for the entity. This can be done by adding the
   following in the [`definition.graphql`](/supergraph-modeling/models#model-modelgraphqldefinition) for `Model`:

   ```yaml
   apolloFederation:
     entitySource: true
   ```

:::info

The Apollo Federation support in DDN only allows extending other subgraphs with DDN types. The other way i.e.
extending DDN types with other subgraphs is not possible currently. i.e. the following is not supported:

The `Review` type defined in DDN:
```graphql
type Review {
  id: ID!
  productId: ID!
  rating: Int!
  comment: String
}
```

The `Product` type defined in another subgraph:
```graphql
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

Currently, we cannot extend the `Review` type with the `Product` type from another subgraph.
