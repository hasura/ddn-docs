# Explain API Reference

## Introduction

The Explain API is an endpoint for analyzing GraphQL queries. Given a query and authorization, it will return the
execution plan for the engine and data connector, if supported.  

## Endpoint

All requests are `POST` requests to the `/v1/explain` endpoint.

## API Spec

### Request

The request expects the exact same payload as the GraphQL API (including authentication related headers).

- `query`: the GraphQL query to be analyzed
- `variables` (optional): the variables used in the GraphQL query
- `operationName` (optional): the name of the GraphQL operation

```http
POST /v1/explain HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "<GraphQL query>",
  "variables": {
    "var1" : "...",
    "var2" : "..."
  }
}
```

#### Sample request

```http
POST /v1/explain HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "query GetAlbumTracks($AlbumId: Int) {\n  AlbumByID(AlbumId: $AlbumId) {\n    Title\n    Tracks {\n      Name\n    }\n  }\n}",
  "variables": {
    "AlbumId": 1
  },
  "operationName": "GetAlbumTracks"
}
```

### Response

The response for a query is the engine' plans for executing the GraphQL query:

```none
{
  "explain": "<ExplainStep>",
  "errors": [<GraphQLError>]
}
```

#### ExplainStep

The `ExplainStep` can be one of the following:

1. `ModelSelect`: A select on the data connector's model
2. `CommandSelect`: A select on the data connector's command
3. `ForEach`: A for-each loop on the data returned by the parent step
4. `HashJoin`: A hash join of the data returned by the steps to construct valid response
5. `Sequence`: A sequential execution of steps
6. `Parallel`: A parallel execution of steps

#### ModelSelect {#modelselect}

A ModelSelect represents a select on the data connector's model. It has the following structure:

```none
{
  "type": "modelSelect",
  "value": {
    "modelName": "<ModelName>",
    "queryRequest": <NDCQueryRequest>,
    "ndcExplain": <NDCExplain>
  }
}
```

The fields in the `ModelSelect` are:

| Key          | Schema          | Description                                 |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| modelName    | String          | The name of the model being selected        |
| queryRequest | [NDCQueryRequest](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/reference/types.html#queryrequest) | The query request sent to the data connector |
| ndcExplain   | NDCExplain      | The explain response from the data connector |

#### CommandSelect {#commandselect}
A CommandSelect represents a select on the data connector's command. It has the following structure:

```none
{
  "type": "commandSelect",
  "value": {
    "commandName": "<CommandName>",
    "queryRequest": <NDCQueryRequest>,
    "ndcExplain": <NDCExplain>
  }
}
```

The fields in the `CommandSelect` are:

| Key          | Schema          | Description                                 |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| commandName  | String          | The name of the command being selected      |
| queryRequest | [NDCQueryRequest](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/reference/types.html#queryrequest) | The query request sent to the data connector |
| ndcExplain   | NDCExplain      | The explain response from the data connector |

#### ForEach

A ForEach represents a for-each loop on the data returned by the parent step. This is present if the engine is going to
perform remote joins. It has the following structure:

```none
{
  "type": "forEach",
  "value": <ForEachStep>
}
```

The value of the `ForEach` step can be either a [ModelSelect](#modelselect) or a [CommandSelect](#commandselect).

#### HashJoin

A HashJoin represents a hash join of the data returned by the steps to construct valid response. This is present if the
engine is going to perform remote joins. It has the following structure:

```none
{
  "type": "hashJoin"
}
```

#### Sequence

A Sequence represents a sequential execution of steps. It has the following structure:

```none
{
  "type": "sequence",
  "value": [<ExplainStep>]
}
```

#### Parallel

A Parallel represents a parallel execution of steps. It has the following structure:

```none
{
  "type": "parallel",
  "value": [<ExplainStep>]
}
```

#### NDCExplain

The `NDCExplain` contains the explanation of the query execution from the DataConnector point of view. It has the following
structure:

```none
{
  "type": "response" || "error" || "notSupported"
  "value": <data connector specific response>
}
```

The `NDCExplain` can be of the following types:
1. `response`: The data-connector supports explaining query and has given a valid response.
2. `error`: The data-connector has raised some error while explaining the query.
3. `notSupported`: The data-connector doesn't support explaining ndc queries.

## Examples

Let's try to understand the meaning of various nodes in [ExplainStep](#explainstep) through examples.

:::note Data Connectors in example

For the examples, we are using the [HasuraHubDataConnector](/supergraph-modeling/data-connectors.mdx#hasura-hub-data-connector).

:::

#### Example 1

Let's try to understand the explanation for the following query:

```graphql
query {
  Album {
    AlbumId
    ArtistId
    Artist { # a remote relationship
      ArtistId
    }
    Tracks { # a local relationship
      TrackId
      Album { # a remote relationship
        AlbumId
      }
    }
  }
}
```
For the above query, we get the following response

```json
{
  "explain": {
    "type": "sequence",
    "value": [
      {
        "type": "modelSelect",
        "value": {

  }
}
```

The steps for the execution are as follows:
- There are three sequential steps:
  - Make a selection from the model cities.
  - Do the following steps in parallel:
    - For each city, fetch the weather
    - For each state, fetch the weather
  - Hash join the results
