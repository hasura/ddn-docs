# Native Queries

Native queries can be defined by adding them to the `"nativeQueries"` section of a connector. Each query is specified as
SQL. The return structure of the query must be explicitly specified in the `"columns"` field.

Native queries can take arguments using the `{{argument_name}}` syntax. Arguments must be specified along with their
type. The arguments are not interpolated, but provided to your data source as parameters, and therefore must be specific
values, not arbitrary SQL.

Here's an example which filters a table called `"Artist"`:

```yaml
---
version: 1
connectionUri:
  uri: postgresql://alice@database.host
metadata:
  tables: {}
  nativeQueries:
    artist_below_id:
      sql: SELECT * FROM public."Artist" WHERE "ArtistId" < {{id}}
      columns:
        ArtistId:
          name: ArtistId
          type: int4
        Name:
          name: Name
          type: varchar
      arguments:
        id:
          name: id
          type: int4
```

This will create a query called `"artist_below_id"` which takes a single argument called `"id"` of type `int4`. The
query will return a list of objects with the fields `"ArtistId"` and `"Name"`.

:::info Availability

Check your connector's documentation on the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors) to see if it supports native
queries.
