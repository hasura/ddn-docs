# Basics of Queries

GraphQL queries are used to **read data** by interacting with [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) in your Hasura
DDN project.

Queries can be used to return multiple records while specifying exactly which fields to include in the response. You can
also query for unique records with the same level of control, retrieving a single result that matches your conditions.

In addition to fetching records, queries can perform aggregations, which allow you to compute and summarize data. For
example, you can count the number of records, calculate averages, or find totals directly in the query response.

Since the GraphQL API is self-documenting, you can write queries manually or use tools like auto-completion and the
GraphiQL explorer in the Hasura DDN console to help you build and test them. GraphiQL displays the available root-level
types, fields, and relationships, making it easier to construct queries accurately.

Depending on the features enabled by a data connector, you will have access to a range of queries as defined here.

- [Simple Queries](/graphql-api/queries/simple-queries.mdx)
- [Nested Queries](/graphql-api/queries/nested-queries.mdx)
- [Sort Query Results](/graphql-api/queries/sorting.mdx)
- [Paginate Query Results](/graphql-api/queries/pagination.mdx)
- [Multiple Arguments](/graphql-api/queries/multiple-arguments.mdx)
- [Multiple Queries](/graphql-api/queries/multiple-queries.mdx)
- [Variables, Aliases, Fragments, Directives](/graphql-api/queries/variables-aliases-fragments-directives.mdx)
- [Filtering Queries](/graphql-api/queries/filters/index.mdx)
  - [Comparing values](/graphql-api/queries/filters/comparison-operators.mdx)
  - [Boolean expressions](/graphql-api/queries/filters/boolean-operators.mdx)
  - [Text](/graphql-api/queries/filters/text-search-operators.mdx)
  - [Nested objects](/graphql-api/queries/filters/nested-objects.mdx)
