# Filter Based on Nested Objects Fields

## Introduction

You can filter your query results by specifying conditions of nested fields of an object.

For example:

```graphql {2}
query {
  articles(where: { author: { name: { _eq: "Sam Jones" } } }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

## Applicable Fields for Nested Field Comparisons

Nested field comparisons can be made in the GraphQL API if:
- The field's type is an [Object Type](supergraph-modeling/types.mdx#objecttype-objecttype)
- The field is a [Relationship](supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx)

## Filtering by Object Type Fields

To filter results based on a field within an object type, apply a condition to the nested field.

**Example:**

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`{
  users (
    where: {
      profile: {
        age: { _gt: 30 }
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    profile {
      age
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "profile": {
          "age": 35
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "profile": {
          "age": 40
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

In this query, `profile` is an [Object Type](supergraph-modeling/types.mdx#objecttype-objecttype) field, and we filter
users based on the condition that their `profile.age` is greater than 30.

## Filtering by Relationship Fields

You can filter results based on conditions applied to the fields of the target model in a relationship.
The relationship can be either an object or array type.

**Example:** Filter by `Array` relationship fields.

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`{
  authors (
    where: {
      books: {
        title: { _like: "graphql" }
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    books {
      title
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "authors": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice Johnson",
        "books": [
          {
            "title": "GraphQL Basics"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Bob Lee",
        "books": [
          {
            "title": "GraphQL Advanced"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

In this query, `books` is an Array relationship, and we filter authors who have written a book titled "GraphQL Basics".


**Example:** Filter by `Object` relationship fields.

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`{
  books (
    where: {
      author: {
        name: { _eq: "Alice Johnson" }
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
    title
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "books": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Learning GraphQL",
        "author": {
          "name": "Alice Johnson"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Advanced GraphQL",
        "author": {
          "name": "Alice Johnson"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

In this query, `author` is an object relationship field, and we filter books where the `author.name` is "Alice Johnson".

### Data Connector Capability

For relationship filtering to be processed efficiently, the data connector must support the `relation_comparisons`
[relationships capability](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/capabilities.html). This allows the query
engine to push down relationship comparisons directly to the data connector, ensuring that filtering based on
relationships is handled at the data source level, improving performance and reducing unnecessary data transfer.

However, if the `relation_comparisons` capability is absent, the query engine will handle the relationship comparisons
at its own layer. In this case, the query engine fetches the relevant mapping field values of the relationship and
constructs the necessary comparison expressions. While this ensures that the query can still execute, it may result
in reduced efficiency and slower responses, as more data needs to be transferred to the query engine for evaluation.
See [Performance of Relationship Comparisons](graphql-api/queries/filters/performance-relationship-comparisons.mdx)
for more details.

#### Compatibility Date

To utilize relationship comparisons without the `relation_comparisons` capability, you must update the compatibility
date. For detailed instructions, please refer to the
[Compatibility Config](supergraph-modeling/compatibility-config.mdx#bypass-relation_comparisons-ndc-capability).
