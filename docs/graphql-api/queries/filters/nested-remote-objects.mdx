# Filter Based on Remote Fields of Nested Objects

## Introduction

You can use the remote fields of nested objects — established via
[relationships](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx) — to filter your query results.

Filtering based on remote fields of nested objects enhances query flexibility by allowing precise data retrieval without
client-side filtering, which improves performance by reducing network data transfer. You can also simplify data access
by leveraging relationships to navigate complex data models and ensures optimized performance by processing only
relevant data on the server side.

For example:

```graphql {2}
query UsersCompletedOrders {
  mySubgraph_users(where: { orders: { status: { _eq: "complete" } } }) {
    id
    name
    orders {
      id
      status
    }
  }
}
```

The behavior of the comparison operators depends on whether the nested objects are a single object related via an object
relationship or an array of objects related via an array relationship.
