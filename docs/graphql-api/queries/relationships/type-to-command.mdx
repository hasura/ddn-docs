# Type to Command Relationship

## Introduction

You can define relationships from an object type to a command. This is helpful
when you want to enrich an object type with related data, but where the related
data is the result of some business logic.

For example, let's say you have a `user` type, and also a command which responds
with the current logged in user information (say `getLoggedInUserInfo`). Now you
can link these two, by defining a relationship from the `user` type to
`getLoggedInUserInfo`. Let's say the relationship name is `currentSession`, then
you make a single query from your client to get a user's data and their current
session information.

**Example:** fetch a list of users and the current session information of each user:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  users {
    id
    username
    currentSession {
      activeSince
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "username": "sit_amet",
        "currentSession": {
          "activeSince": "2024-04-01T07:08:22+0000"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "username": "fancy_nibh",
        "currentSession": {
          "activeSince": "2024-04-01T07:08:22+0000"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "username": "just_joe",
        "currentSession": {
          "activeSince": "2024-04-01T07:08:22+0000"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

## Defining type-to-command relationship

To define a type-to-command relationship, you need define a `kind: Relationship`
metadata object, and choose the target of the relationship to be a command.
Check the [relationship
modelling](../../../supergraph-modeling/relationships) page for more
details.
