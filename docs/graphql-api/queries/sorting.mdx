# Sort Query Results

## The **order_by** argument

Results from your query can be sorted by using the `order_by` argument. The argument can be used to sort nested objects
too.

The sort order (ascending vs. descending) is set by specifying the `Asc` or `Desc` enum value for the column name in the
`order_by` input object, e.g. `{name: Desc}`.

By default, for ascending ordering `null` values are returned at the end of the results and for descending ordering
`null` values are returned at the start of the results.

The `order_by` argument takes an array of objects to allow sorting by multiple columns.

You can also use nested objects' fields to sort the results. Only columns from object relationships** and **aggregates
from array relationships\*\* can be used for sorting.

The following are example queries for different sorting use cases:

## Sorting objects

**Example:** Fetch a list of authors sorted by their names in ascending order:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  authors (
    order_by: {name: Asc}
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "authors": [
      {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Amii"
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Anjela"
      },
      {
        "id": 8,
        "name": "April"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Beltran"
      },
      {
        "id": 7,
        "name": "Berti"
      },
      {
        "id": 6,
        "name": "Corny"
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

## Sorting nested objects {#pg-nested-sort}

**Example:** Fetch a list of authors sorted by their names with a list of their articles that is sorted by their rating:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  authors (order_by: {name: Asc}) {
    id
    name
    articles(order_by: {rating: Desc}) {
      id
      title
      rating
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "authors": [
      {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Amii",
        "articles": [
          {
            "rating": 5,
            "id": 17,
            "title": "montes nascetur ridiculus"
          },
          {
            "rating": 3,
            "id": 12,
            "title": "volutpat quam pede"
          },
          {
            "rating": 2,
            "id": 4,
            "title": "vestibulum ac est"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Anjela",
        "articles": [
          {
            "rating": 4,
            "id": 3,
            "title": "amet justo morbi"
          },
          {
            "rating": 1,
            "id": 1,
            "title": "sit amet"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 8,
        "name": "April",
        "articles": [
          {
            "rating": 4,
            "id": 13,
            "title": "vulputate elementum"
          },
          {
            "rating": 2,
            "id": 20,
            "title": "eu nibh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

## Sorting by Nested Object Fields

Only **columns from object relationships** can be used for sorting.

You can sort results based on fields from object relationships, limited to local object relationships between two
collections at the moment.

:::caution Limitations

- Sorting is supported only for local relationships (between local collections).
- Sorting on Array relationships are not supported yet.
- Sorting based on remote relationships (remote databases or Remote Schema) is not supported yet. :::

:::

### For object relationships

For object relationships only columns can be used for sorting.

**Example:** Fetch a list of articles that are sorted by their author's ids in descending order:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  articles (
    order_by: {author: {id: Desc}}
  ) {
    id
    rating
    published_on
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "articles": [
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Article 3",
        "content": "Sample article content 3",
        "author": {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Author 2"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Article 1",
        "content": "Sample article content 1",
        "author": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Author 1"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Article 2",
        "content": "Sample article content 2",
        "author": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Author 1"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

## Sorting by multiple fields

As stated above, `order_by` expects an object with only a single key-value pair. Should you attempt to pass multiple
key-value pairs, like in the example below where we're attempting to sort by both `lastSeen` and then `createdAt`,
you'll receive a validation error like this:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query UserQuery {
  app_users(order_by: {lastSeen: Asc, createdAt: Asc}) {
    id
    name
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "validation failed: order_by expects a list of input objects with exactly one key-value pair per input object. Please split the input object with multiple key-value pairs into a list of single key-value pair objects."
    }
  ]
}`}
/>

This happens commonly when using the explorer in GraphiQL to select `order_by` fields. Instead, you can format your
query like this wherein an array of objects is passed:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query UserQuery {
  app_users(order_by: [{lastSeen: Asc}, {createdAt: Asc}]) {
    id
    name
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "app_users": [
      {
        "id": "7cf0a66c-65b7-11ed-b904-fb49f034fbbb",
        "name": "Sean"
      },
      {
        "id": "82001336-65b7-11ed-b905-7fa26a16d198",
        "name": "Rob"
      },
      {
        "id": "86d5fba0-65b7-11ed-b906-afb985970e2e",
        "name": "Marion"
      },
      {
        "id": "8dea1160-65b7-11ed-b907-e3c5123cb650",
        "name": "Sandeep"
      },
      {
        "id": "9bd9d300-65b7-11ed-b908-571fef22d2ba",
        "name": "Abby"
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

:::info Key order is not preserved

Key order in input object for `order_by` is not preserved. This means you should only have a single key per object, or
you may see unexpected behavior.
