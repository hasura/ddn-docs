# Aggregation Queries

## **Aggregate** fields

You can fetch aggregations on columns along with nodes using an aggregation query.

The **name of the aggregate field** is of the form `<field-name>Aggregate`.

Common aggregation functions are `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `max`, `min`, etc. You can see the complete specification of the
aggregate field in the [metadata reference](/supergraph-modeling/aggregate-expressions.mdx). Note that not all
aggregation functions are available for all data types.

## Fetch aggregated data of an object

**Example:** Fetch a list of posts with aggregated data:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query PostsAndAggregate {
    posts {
    id
    title
  }
  postsAggregate {
    _count
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "posts": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "My First Post"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Another Post"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Bob's Post"
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "Hello World"
      },
      {
        "id": 5,
        "title": "Charlie has more to say"
      }
    ],
    "postsAggregate": {
      "_count": 5
    }
  }
}`}
/>

## Fetch aggregated data on nested objects {#nested-aggregate}

The following is an example of a nested object query with aggregations on the **array relationship** between a user and
posts.

**Example:** Fetch user with an `id` of `1` and a nested list of posts with aggregated data:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query ArticlesSummaryByAuthor {
  usersById(id: "1") {
    id
    name
    postsAggregate {
      _count
    }
    posts {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "usersById": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Alice",
      "postsAggregate": {
        "_count": 2
      },
      "posts": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "My First Post"
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "title": "Another Post"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}`}
/>
