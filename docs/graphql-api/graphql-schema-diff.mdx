# GraphQL Schema Diff

When you are managing a GraphQL API, you often need to make changes to the schema. These changes could be adding new
fields, removing existing fields, or changing the types of fields. When you make these changes, you need to understand
the impact of these changes on the existing queries and mutations. The schema diff feature helps you understand these
impacts by comparing the schemas of two supergraph builds.

## Using the GraphQL Schema Diff feature in Console

1. Go to [DDN console](https://console.hasura.io) and select a project. (Make sure you have a project with at least
two supergraph builds if you don't have two supergraph builds, head to
   [Getting Started](/getting-started/build/index.mdx) to create builds to get started).
2. Select a build that you want to compare from the **Builds** header toolbar.
3. In the DDN project console, navigate to the **Builds** section from the sidebar
4. In the **Builds** section, navigate to the **Schema Diff** tab.
5. In the **Schema Diff** tab, you can select two supergraph builds to compare their schemas.
6. You can see the differences between the two schemas in the **Schema Diff** tab.

## Reference and Compare Builds

Imagine that you already have supergraph build **A** applied to your Hasura DDN project and you want to see the
impact of applying a new supergraph build **B**. You can select build **A** as the `Reference Build` and build B as
the `Compare Build` to compare the schemas.

Which means if there are fields added in build **B** without removing any fields from build **A**, the schema diff will
show these as safe changes and list them in the `Safe` section. If there are fields removed in build **B**, the
schema diff will show these as breaking changes and list them in the `Breaking` section.

## Schema Diff Analysis

The schema diff analysis in Hasura DDN is divided into three sections: `Breaking`, `Dangerous`, and `Safe`.

---

### Breaking Changes

**Definition:** Breaking changes are modifications that can disrupt existing GraphQL operations such as queries,
mutations, or subscriptions. These changes typically involve removing or renaming fields, types, or arguments.

**Examples:**

1. **Field Removal:**

   - **Source Build:**
     ```graphql
     type Query {
       sales_hello: String
     }
     ```
   - **Target Build:**
     ```graphql
     type Query {
       // sales_hello field is removed
     }
     ```
   - **Impact:** Any client queries requesting `sales_hello` will fail.

2. **Type Removal:**
   - **Source Build:**
     ```graphql
     type User {
       id: ID!
       name: String!
     }
     ```
   - **Target Build:**
     ```graphql
     // User type is removed
     ```
   - **Impact:** Any client queries or mutations involving the `User` type will fail.

---

### Dangerous Changes

**Definition:** Dangerous changes are modifications that can potentially alter the behavior of existing GraphQL
operations without necessarily breaking them. These changes include modifications to field types, arguments, or default
values.

**Examples:**

1. **Field Type Change:**

   - **Source Build:**
     ```graphql
     type Query {
       sales_count: Int
     }
     ```
   - **Target Build:**
     ```graphql
     type Query {
       sales_count: Float
     }
     ```
   - **Impact:** Queries that expect an `Int` return type might misinterpret the `Float` value, potentially causing
     issues in client-side logic.

2. **Argument Default Value Change:**
   - **Source Build:**
     ```graphql
     type Query {
       products(limit: Int = 10): [Product]
     }
     ```
   - **Target Build:**
     ```graphql
     type Query {
       products(limit: Int = 20): [Product]
     }
     ```
   - **Impact:** Queries relying on the default value of `limit` will get more results than expected.

### Safe Changes

**Definition:** Safe changes are modifications that do not disrupt existing GraphQL operations. These changes typically
involve adding new fields, types, or arguments, enhancing the schema without affecting current functionality.

**Examples:**

1. **Field Addition:**

   - **Source Build:**
     ```graphql
     type Query {
       sales_total: Float
     }
     ```
   - **Target Build:**
     ```graphql
     type Query {
       sales_total: Float
       sales_average: Float // New field added
     }
     ```
   - **Impact:** Existing queries remain unaffected, and new queries can utilize the `sales_average` field.

2. **Type Addition:**
   - **Source Build:**
     ```graphql
     type Query {
       product(id: ID!): Product
     }
     ```
   - **Target Build:**
     ```graphql
     type Query {
       product(id: ID!): Product
       category(id: ID!): Category // New type and query added
     }
     ```
   - **Impact:** Existing queries remain unaffected, and new queries can utilize the `category` query.
