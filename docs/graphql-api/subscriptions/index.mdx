# Basics of Subscriptions

## Introduction

Subscriptions allow you to push **real-time updates** from your data sources to clients, making them ideal for building
reactive applications without constant polling.

## Configuration

You can enable subscriptions on your GraphQL API in the following ways:

### New Hasura DDN project

If you're starting fresh, set up a Hasura DDN project using the [quickstart](/quickstart.mdx) guide. After adding your
models to the supergraph using the [`ddn model add`](/cli/commands/ddn_model_add.mdx) command, subscription capabilities
are automatically generated! For further customization, you can [edit the metadata](#metadata-configuration).

### Existing Hasura DDN project

To enable subscriptions in an existing DDN project, use the following CLI command:

```bash
ddn codemod upgrade-graphqlconfig-subscriptions
```

This command updates the local metadata files, adding subscription-specific configurations. After running this, create a
supergraph build and test the subscriptions on the API. For further customization, you can
[edit the metadata](#metadata-configuration).

### Metadata configuration

You can configure the overall usage of subscriptions in your GraphQL API using
[the `GraphQlConfig` object](/supergraph-modeling/graphql-config.mdx#graphqlconfig-subscriptiongraphqlconfig) in your
metadata.

Additionally, you can customize individual subscriptions by modifying the
[`SubscriptionGraphQlDefinition` field](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx#model-subscriptiongraphqldefinition) on any
model's `selectUniques`, `selectMany`, or `aggregate` fields.
