# Multi-Region Routing

With multi-region routing, you can easily ensure that data is fetched from the data source closest to the user, thus
minimizing latency for the request, improving the performance of your application, and providing a better user
experience.

:::note Currently only supported for PostgreSQL

Multi-region routing is currently supported only for PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL-compatible
[data sources](https://hasura.io/connectors#connectors-list).

:::

To use multi-region routing in Hasura DDN, you only need a supported data source deployed in (or near) more than one
of the [supported regions](#supported-regions).

:::warning Same schema for all data sources

You must ensure all data sources share exactly the same schema. If there is any ambiguity between them, the metadata
build will fail.

## Configuration

If you don't have a project setup that lets you query PostgreSQL, please follow
[this guide](/getting-started/1-create-a-project.mdx). Once you have a working project, you can modify the
`ConnectorManifest` configuration as shown below to enable multi-region routing.

```yaml
kind: ConnectorManifest
version: v1
spec:
  supergraphManifests:
    - base
definition:
  name: mypg
  type: cloud
  connector:
    type: hub
    name: hasura/postgres:v0.6.0
  deployments:
    - context: .
      mode: ReadWrite
      region: gcp-us-west2
      env:
        CONNECTION_URI:
          valueFrom: CONNECTION_URI_FOR_READ_WRITE_REPLICA
    - context: .
      mode: ReadOnly
      region: gcp-us-east4
      env:
        CONNECTION_URI:
          valueFrom: CONNECTION_URI_FOR_READ_REPLICA_IN_US_EAST4
    - context: .
      mode: ReadOnly
      region: gcp-europe-west1
      env:
        CONNECTION_URI:
          valueFrom: CONNECTION_URI_FOR_READ_REPLICA_IN_EUROPE_WEST1
```

In the above configuration example, Hasura DDN will route all the write queries (mutations) to the PostgreSQL database
in the `gcp-us-west2` region and the read queries (queries and subscriptions) to either `gcp-us-east4` or
`gcp-europe-west1` based on the geolocation of the client.

## Supported regions

Currently, Hasura DDN supports the following regions in GCP for multi-region routing:

- `gcp-asia-south1`
- `gcp-asia-southeast1`
- `gcp-australia-southeast1`
- `gcp-europe-west1`
- `gcp-southamerica-east1`
- `gcp-us-east4`
- `gcp-us-west2`
