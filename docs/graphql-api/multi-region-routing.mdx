# Multi-Region Routing with the Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL

With multi-region Routing, you can easily ensure that the data is fetched from the data source closest to the user,
thus minimizing latency for the request.

For multi-region Routing, you only need a supported data source deployed in (or near) more than one of the
[supported regions](#supported-regions).


:::info Same schema for all databases

You must ensure that the schema for the different PostgresSQL databases are exactly same. If there is any ambiguity
between the schemas, then the metadata build would fail.

:::

## Configuration

For multi-region routing, you will add configuration for each of the data sources' metadata objects

An example configuration for the PostgreSQL `HasuraHubDataConnector`is provided below:

```yaml {7-8,26-27}
kind: HasuraHubDataConnector
version: v1
definition:
  name: db
  connectorId: hasura/postgres
  connectorConfiguration:
  - region: gcp-europe-west1
    mode: ReadOnly
    configuration:
      version: 1
      metadata: &db-metadata
        tables:
          Album:
            schemaName: public
            tableName: Album
            columns:
              AlbumId:
                name: AlbumId
                type: integer
      aggregateFunctions:
        integer: {}
        text: {}
      connectionUri:
        uri:
          stringValueFromSecret: PG_EUROPE_URL
  - region: gcp-us-east4
    mode: ReadWrite
    configuration:
      version: 1
      metadata: *db-metadata
      aggregateFunctions:
        integer: {}
        text: {}
      connectionUri:
        uri:
          stringValueFromSecret: PG_US_URL
```

For the above configuration, Hasura DDN will route all the write queries (mutations) to the database in the
`gcp-us-east4` region and the read queries (query and subscriptions) to either `gcp-us-east4` or `gcp-europe-west1`
based on the geolocation of the client.

## Supported regions

Currently, Hasura DDN supports the following regions:

- `gcp-asia-south1`
- `gcp-asia-southeast1`
- `gcp-australia-southeast1`
- `gcp-europe-west1`
- `gcp-southamerica-east1`
- `gcp-us-east4`
- `gcp-us-west2`
