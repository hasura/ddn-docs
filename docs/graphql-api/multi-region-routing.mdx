# Multi-Region Routing with the Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL

With multi-region routing, you can easily ensure that the data is fetched from the data source closest to the user, thus
minimizing latency for the request.

For multi-region routing, you only need a supported data source deployed in (or near) more than one of the
[supported regions](#supported-regions).

:::info Same schema for all databases

You must ensure that the schema for the different databases are exactly same. If there is any ambiguity between the
schemas, then the metadata build would fail.

:::

## Configuration

For multi-region routing, you will add configuration for each of the data sources' metadata objects

An example configuration for the PostgreSQL `HasuraHubDataConnector`is provided below:

```yaml {7-8,26-27}
kind: HasuraHubDataConnector
version: v1
definition:
  name: db
  connectorId: hasura/postgres
  connectorConfiguration:
    - region: gcp-europe-west1
      mode: ReadOnly
      configuration:
        version: 1
        metadata: &db-metadata
          tables:
            Album:
              schemaName: public
              tableName: Album
              columns:
                AlbumId:
                  name: AlbumId
                  type: integer
        aggregateFunctions:
          integer: {}
          text: {}
        connectionUri:
          uri:
            stringValueFromSecret: PG_EUROPE_URL
    - region: gcp-us-east4
      mode: ReadWrite
      configuration:
        version: 1
        metadata: *db-metadata
        aggregateFunctions:
          integer: {}
          text: {}
        connectionUri:
          uri:
            stringValueFromSecret: PG_US_URL
```

For the above configuration, Hasura DDN will route all the write queries (mutations) to the database in the
`gcp-us-east4` region and the read queries (query and subscriptions) to either `gcp-us-east4` or `gcp-europe-west1`
based on the geolocation of the client.

## Supported regions

Currently, Hasura DDN supports the following regions:

- `gcp-asia-south1`
- `gcp-asia-southeast1`
- `gcp-australia-southeast1`
- `gcp-europe-west1`
- `gcp-southamerica-east1`
- `gcp-us-east4`
- `gcp-us-west2`
