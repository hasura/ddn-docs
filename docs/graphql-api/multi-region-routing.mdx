# Multi-Region Routing with the Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL

With multi-region routing, you can easily ensure that the data is fetched from the data source closest to the user, thus
minimizing latency for the request.

For multi-region routing, you only need a supported data source deployed in (or near) more than one of the
[supported regions](#supported-regions).

:::info Same schema for all databases

You must ensure that the schema for the different databases are exactly same. If there is any ambiguity between the
schemas, then the metadata build would fail.

## Configuration

```yaml
kind: ConnectorManifest
version: v1
spec:
  supergraphManifests:
    - base
definition:
  name: mypg
  type: cloud
  connector:
    type: hub
    name: hasura/postgres:v0.6.0
  deployments:
    - context: .
      mode: ReadWrite
      region: gcp-us-west2
      env:
        CONNECTION_URI:
          valueFrom: CONNECTION_URI_FOR_READ_WRITE_REPLICA
    - context: .
      mode: ReadOnly
      region: gcp-us-east4
      env:
        CONNECTION_URI:
          valueFrom: CONNECTION_URI_FOR_READ_REPLICA_IN_US_EAST4
    - context: .
      mode: ReadOnly
      region: gcp-europe-west1
      env:
        CONNECTION_URI:
          valueFrom: CONNECTION_URI_FOR_READ_REPLICA_IN_EUROPE_WEST1
```

For the above configuration, Hasura DDN will route all the write queries (mutations) to the database in the
`gcp-us-west2` region and the read queries (query and subscriptions) to either `gcp-us-east4` or `gcp-europe-west1`
based on the geolocation of the client.

## Supported regions

Currently, Hasura DDN supports the following regions:

- `gcp-asia-south1`
- `gcp-asia-southeast1`
- `gcp-australia-southeast1`
- `gcp-europe-west1`
- `gcp-southamerica-east1`
- `gcp-us-east4`
- `gcp-us-west2`
