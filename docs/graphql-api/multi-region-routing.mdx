# Multi-Region Routing

With multi-region routing, you can easily ensure that data is fetched from the data source closest to the user, thus
minimizing latency for the request, improving the performance of your application, and providing a better user
experience.

:::note Currently only supported for PostgreSQL

Multi-region routing is currently supported only for PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL-compatible
[data sources](https://hasura.io/connectors#connectors-list).

:::

To use multi-region routing in Hasura DDN, you only need a supported data source deployed in (or near) more than one of
the [supported regions](#supported-regions).

## Configuration

If you don't have a project setup that lets you query PostgreSQL, please follow
[this guide](/getting-started/overview.mdx). Once you have a working project, you can modify the `Connector` object as
per the highlighted values in the example below to enable multi-region routing.

```yaml title="For example, in my_subgraph/connector/my_connector/connector.yaml:"
kind: Connector
version: v1
definition:
  name: my_connector
  subgraph: my_subgraph
  source: hasura/connector_name:<version>
  context: .
  envFile: .env.cloud
  #highlight-start
  regionConfiguration:
    - region: <region from the list below>
      mode: ReadWrite
  #highlight-end
```

## Supported regions

Currently, Hasura DDN supports the following regions in GCP for multi-region routing:

- `gcp-asia-south1`
- `gcp-asia-southeast1`
- `gcp-australia-southeast1`
- `gcp-europe-west1`
- `gcp-southamerica-east1`
- `gcp-us-east4`
- `gcp-us-west2`
