# GraphQL API Errors

## Introduction

The GraphQL API returns an error response when the requested operation fails to execute successfully. Hasura provides
the error responses that adhere to the [GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Errors). Each error
object contains only the `message` field, providing a string description of the error intended for the API consumer.

:::info Note In future iterations, the error object could be expanded with additional information, such as path and
error code. :::

Below is an example of an error response triggered by a negative value for the `limit` argument:

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Unexpected value: expecting NON-NEGATIVE 32-bit INT, but found: -10"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Internal Errors

Internal errors are exceptions that are unexpected in the API execution cycle. GraphQL API responses for internal errors
only contain the message `internal error`.

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "internal error"
    }
  ]
}
```

As an API author, you have access to details of certain internal errors, including but not limited to:

- [DDN metadata](/supergraph-modeling/overview), such as the absence of a data source for model or command root fields
  and arguments, and the omission of required session variables in the request.
- [Data connector](/connectors/overview) interactions, which are useful for debugging connection or interface errors
  with your [custom](/connectors/build-your-own-connector) data connectors.

The details of an internal error are available through [traces](/observability/traces). It is recommended to review all
error spans within the trace to obtain details of the internal error. If still the trace does not reveal the details,
the error may originate from Hasura internals. In such cases, please reach out to Hasura support with the trace ID.
