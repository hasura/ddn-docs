A Global ID is a unique identifier for an object across the entire application, not just within a specific table or
type. Think of it as an ID which you can use to fetch any object directly, regardless of what kind of object it is. This
is different from typical database IDs, which are often guaranteed unique only within a particular table.

[//]: # "TODO: As long as it has already been fetched?"

Hasura's Global ID implementation can be used to provide options for GraphQL clients to elegantly handle caching and
data re-fetching in a predictable and standardized way.

The Global ID generated by Hasura DDN follows the
[Relay Global ID spec](https://relay.dev/graphql/objectidentification.htm).

As the example below shows, the `user` object type has a field `user_id` that uniquely identifies a user. The Global ID
for the `user` object type will be generated using the `user_id` field:

For the following request on a model which has enabled Global ID:

```graphql
{
  user_by_id(user_id: 1) {
    id // Global ID
    user_id
    name
  }
}
```

The response obtained should look like the following:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user_by_id": {
      "id": "eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlbmFtZSI6IkFydGljbGUiLCJpZCI6eyJhcnRpY2xlX2lkIjoyfX0=",
      "user_id": 1,
      "name": "Bob"
    }
  }
}
```

Now, with the Global ID received above, the `User` object corresponding to `user_id: 1` can be retrieved, as shown
below.

```graphql
{
  node(id: "eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlbmFtZSI6IkFydGljbGUiLCJpZCI6eyJhcnRpY2xlX2lkIjoyfX0=") {
    id
    __typename
    ... on User {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The response to the above request should identify the `User` with `user_id: 1`.

```json
{
  "node": {
    "id": "eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlbmFtZSI6IkFydGljbGUiLCJpZCI6eyJhcnRpY2xlX2lkIjoyfX0=",
    "__typename": "User",
    "name": "Bob"
  }
}
```
