## Introduction

A Global ID is a unique identifier for an object across the entire application, not just within a specific table or
type. Think of it as an `id` which you can use to fetch any object in your entire supergraph directly, regardless of
what kind of object it is. This is different from typical database IDs, which are often guaranteed unique only within a
particular table.

Hasura's Global ID implementation can be used to provide options for GraphQL clients, such as
[Relay](https://relay.dev/), to elegantly handle caching and data re-fetching in a predictable and standardized way.

The Global ID generated by Hasura DDN follows the
[GraphQL Global Object Identification spec](https://graphql.org/learn/global-object-identification/).

## Using the Global ID

As the example below shows, our users have Global IDs enabled and we can request back the `id` Global ID field for
any particular user. Then, this `id` can be used to fetch this user directly using a `node` query.

For the following GraphQL request on a model which has enabled Global IDs:

```graphql
{
  userById(user_id: 1) {
    id # This is the global ID of the object in the supergraph
    user_id # This is the unique identifier of object. Eg: a row in a table.
    name
  }
}
```

The response obtained should look like the following:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "userById": {
      "id": "eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlbmFtZSI6IlVzZXJzIiwiaWQiOnsidXNlcl9pZCI6IjEifX0=",
      "user_id": 1,
      "name": "Bob"
    }
  }
}
```

**Global ID vs Unique Identifier**

- `user_id`: In this example, this is the unique identifier of the object. Eg: a row in a table.
- `id`: This is the global ID of the object in the graph. It is unique across the entire supergraph. It must be
named `id` to conform with the GraphQL spec.

To enable Global IDs on a Model which already have an `id` field, you will need to remap the existing `id` field to
another name. [See here](#globalid-remap-id-field)

Now, with the Global ID received above, the `User` object corresponding to `user_id: 1` can be retrieved, as shown
below.

```graphql
{
  node(id: "eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlbmFtZSI6IlVzZXJzIiwiaWQiOnsidXNlcl9pZCI6IjEifX0=") {
    id
    __typename
    ... on User {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The response to the above request should identify the `User` with `user_id: 1`.

```json
{
  "node": {
    "id": "eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlbmFtZSI6IlVzZXJzIiwiaWQiOnsidXNlcl9pZCI6IjEifX0=",
    "__typename": "User",
    "name": "Bob"
  }
}
```

:::info Global ID format

The Global ID is a base64 encoded string. Eg:

```text
eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlbmFtZSI6IlVzZXJzIiwiaWQiOnsidXNlcl9pZCI6IjEifX0=
```

Is decoded as the following:

```string
{"version":1,"typename":"Users","id":{"user_id":"1"}}
```

This strategy guarantees that the Global ID is unique across the entire supergraph.

## Enabling Global ID in metadata

You will need to edit a minimum of two objects in metadata to enable Global ID:

1. In the `ObjectType` `definition`, specify which field, or set of fields, should be used as the source(s) to create
   the Global ID . The following example uses a `user_id` field to create it:

```yaml
globalIdFields: [user_id]
```

See more in the [ObjectType definition](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx#objecttype-objecttypev1).

2. Then add the following to the `definition` section of the `Model`:

```yaml
globalIdSource: true
```

See more in the [Model definition](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx#model-modelv1).


## Enabling Global ID for Models which already have an `id` field {#globalid-remap-id-field}

It's a common occurrence to have an existing field in your `ObjectType` named `id`. Since the GraphQL spec mandates
that the `id` field should be for the Global ID, you will need to remap the existing `id` field to a different field
name.

With the help of the Hasura VS Code extension and the output errors from the metadata build service in the Hasura CLI,
you can easily determine which fields need to be remapped.

In the ObjectType definition, you can remap the `id` field to a different field name `user_id` for example, as shown
below:

```yaml {5,7-8,18-20}
kind: ObjectType
version: v1
definition:
  name: Users
  globalIdFields: [user_id]
  fields:
    - name: user_id
      type: Uuid!
    - name: name
      type: Text!
  graphql:
    typeName: App_Users
    inputTypeName: App_UsersInput
  dataConnectorTypeMapping:
    - dataConnectorName: postgres_connector
      dataConnectorObjectType: users
      fieldMapping:
        user_id:
          column:
            name: id
        name:
          column:
            name: name
```


You will then also need to update the `Model`, `TypePermissions` and `Relationships` definitions and anywhere else
where the previous identifier of `id` for the `User` model was used.

You will also need to edit the `target` metadata for `Relationships` in other Models too so that they reference the
new identifier of `user_id`.

As mentioned, the Hasura VS Code extension and the output errors from the metadata build service in the Hasura CLI will
help you find all the places where the `id` field needs to be remapped.
