# API Versioning through Field Deprecation

## Introduction

As your API grows and adapts to new features or functionality, you might need to adjust its structure. But changing or
removing fields in API responses can cause breaking changes. These changes may disrupt client applications that depend
on those fields, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Hasura supports the `@deprecated` directive in GraphQL, making it straightforward to mark fields as deprecated. You can
include an optional reason to help explain the change, signaling to consumers which fields are outdated or updated.

As an example, imagine we have a type `Car` with an existing field named `engine` which is deprecated in favor of
`motor`:

```graphql
type Car {
  id: ID!
  make: String!
  model: String!
  engine: EngineSpec @deprecated(reason: "Use field 'motor' instead")
  motor: MotorSpec
}
```

Consumers of our API will know that `engine` has been deprecated, _why_ we've deprecated it, and which field to use in
its place.

## Using field deprecation in DDN

The following metadata objects have field deprecation in their GraphQL configuration.

### Model

The following example shows how to deprecate a field in a [model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx):

```yaml
kind: Model
version: V1
definition:
  name: Cars
  objectType: Car
  orderableFields:
    - Id
  graphql:
    selectUniques:
      - queryRootField: selectCar
        uniqueIdentifier:
          - make
          - model
        deprecated:
          reason: Use selectCarById instead
      - queryRootField: selectCarById
        uniqueIdentifier:
          - Id
```

And the resulting schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  selectCar(make: String!, model: String): Car @deprecated(reason: "use selectCarById instead")
  selectCarById(Id: ID!): Car
}
```

### Command

The following example shows how to deprecate a field in a [command](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx):

```yaml
kind: Command
version: V1
definition:
  name: GetEngineSpec
  outputType: Engine
  graphql:
    rootFieldName: getEngineSpec
    rootFieldKind: Query
    deprecated:
      reason: "Fuel Engines are no longer supported from Jan 01 2035"
```

And the resulting schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  getEngineSpec: Engine @deprecated(reason: "Fuel Engines are no longer supported from Jan 01 2035")
}
```

### ObjectType

The following example shows how to deprecate a field in an
[ObjectType](/reference/metadata-reference/types.mdx#objecttype-objecttype):

```yaml
kind: ObjectType
version: V1
definition:
  name: Car
  fields:
    - name: Id
      type: String
    - name: make
      type: String
    - name: model
      type: String
    - name: engine
      type: String
      deprecated:
        reason: Use motor field instead
    - name: motor
      type: String
  graphql:
    typeName: Car
```

And the resulting schema:

```graphql
type Car {
  Id: String
  make: String
  model: String
  engine: String @deprecated(reason: "Use motor field instead")
  motor: String
}
```

### Relationship

The following example shows how to deprecate a field in a
[relationship](/reference/metadata-reference/relationships.mdx):

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version: V1
definition:
  name: engineSpec
  source: Car
  target:
    command:
    name: GetEngineSpec
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: engine
      target:
        argument:
          argumentName: name
  deprecated:
    reason: Engines on cars are no longer supported from Jan 01 2035
```

And the resulting schema:

```graphql
type Car {
  Id: String
  make: String
  model: String
  engine: String @deprecated(reason: "Use motor field instead")
  motor: String
  engineSpec: Engine @deprecated(reason: "Engines on cars are no longer supported from Jan 01 2035")
  motorSpec: Motor
}
```

## Default deprecation reason

In cases where no deprecation reason is explicitly provided, the `@deprecated` directive defaults to
`No longer supported` as the reason.

The following example from [ObjectType](/reference/metadata-reference/types.mdx#objecttype-objecttype) metadata
illustrates deprecating a field without specifying a reason.

```yaml
kind: ObjectType
version: V1
definition:
  name: Car
  fields:
    - name: Id
      type: String
    - name: make
      type: String
    - name: model
      type: String
    - name: engine
      type: String
      deprecated:
        reason: null
    - name: motor
      type: String
  graphql:
    typeName: Car
```

And the resulting schema:

```graphql
type Car {
  Id: String

  model: String
  engine: String @deprecated(reason: "No longer supported")
  motor: String
}
```
