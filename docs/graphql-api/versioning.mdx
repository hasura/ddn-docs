# API Versioning through Field Deprecation

## Introduction

As your API evolves to support new features or improved functionality, changes to its existing structure might be
required. However, directly altering or removing fields in the API responses can lead to breaking changes.These can
disrupt the functionality of client applications that rely on those fields, potentially causing errors or failures in
application behavior.

Hasura enables you to easily use the built-in `@deprecated` schema directive of GraphQL to tag a field as deprecated
with an optional reason. This tag allows you to easily mark fields that are no longer valid or those that have been
updated as deprecated with a note alerting your consumers to the change.

As an example, imagine we have a type `Car` with an existing field named `engine` which is deprecated in favor of
`motor`:

```graphql
type Car {
  id: ID!
  make: String!
  model: String!
  engine: EngineSpec @deprecated(reason: "Use field 'motor' instead")
  motor: MotorSpec
}
```

Consumers of our API will know that `engine` has been deprecated, _why_ we've deprecated it, and which field to use in
its place.

## Using Field Deprecation in DDN Modeling

The following metadata objects have field deprecation in their GraphQL configuration.

### Model

The following example shows how to deprecate a field in a [model](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx):

```yaml
kind: Model
version: V1
definition:
  name: Cars
  objectType: Car
  orderableFields:
  - Id
  graphql:
    selectUniques:
    - queryRootField: selectCar
      uniqueIdentifier:
      - make
      - model
      deprecated:
        reason: Use selectCarById instead
    - queryRootField: selectCarById
      uniqueIdentifier:
      - Id
```

And the resulting schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  selectCar(make: String!, model: String): Car @deprecated(reason: "use selectCarById instead")
  selectCarById(Id: ID!): Car
}
```

### Command

The following example shows how to deprecate a field in a [command](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx):

```yaml
kind: Command
version: V1
definition:
  name: GetEngineSpec
  outputType: Engine
  graphql:
    rootFieldName: getEngineSpec
    rootFieldKind: Query
    deprecated:
      reason: "Fuel Engines are no longer supported from Jan 01 2035"
```

And the resulting schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  getEngineSpec: Engine @deprecated(reason: "Fuel Engines are no longer supported from Jan 01 2035")
}
```

### ObjectType

The following example shows how to deprecate a field in an
[ObjectType](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx#objecttype-objecttype):

```yaml
kind: ObjectType
version: V1
definition:
  name: Car
  fields:
  - name: Id
    type: String
  - name: make
    type: String
  - name: model
    type: String
  - name: engine
    type: String
    deprecated:
      reason: Use motor field instead
  - name: motor
    type: String
  graphql:
      typeName: Car
```

And the resulting schema:

```graphql
type Car {
  Id: String
  make: String
  model: String
  engine: String @deprecated(reason: "Use motor field instead")
  motor: String
}
```

### Relationship

The following example shows how to deprecate a field in a [relationship](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx):

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version: V1
definition:
  name: engineSpec
  source: Car
  target:
    command:
    name: GetEngineSpec
  mapping:
  - source:
      fieldPath:
      - fieldName: engine
    target:
      argument:
        argumentName: name
  deprecated:
    reason: Engines on cars are no longer supported from Jan 01 2035
```

And the resulting schema:

```graphql
type Car {
  Id: String
  make: String
  model: String
  engine: String @deprecated(reason: "Use motor field instead")
  motor: String
  engineSpec: Engine @deprecated(reason: "Engines on cars are no longer supported from Jan 01 2035")
  motorSpec: Motor
}
```

## Default Deprecation Reason

In cases where no deprecation reason is explicitly provided, the `@deprecated` directive defaults to `No longer supported` as the reason.

The following example from [ObjectType](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx#objecttype-objecttype) metadata illustrates deprecating a field without specifying a reason.

```yaml
kind: ObjectType
version: V1
definition:
  name: Car
  fields:
  - name: Id
    type: String
  - name: make
    type: String
  - name: model
    type: String
  - name: engine
    type: String
    deprecated:
      reason: null
  - name: motor
    type: String
  graphql:
      typeName: Car
```

And the resulting schema:

```graphql
type Car {
  Id: String

  model: String
  engine: String @deprecated(reason: "No longer supported")
  motor: String
}
```
