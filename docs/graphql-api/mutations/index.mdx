# GraphQL Mutations

Mutations are used to modify data in a database. They are analogous to the `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands in
SQL. Hasura provides a powerful and flexible GraphQL API to perform mutations.

## Next steps

Currently, you can perform mutations via the GraphQL API using the following methods:

- If using a compatible data source — such as PostgreSQL — you can create a
  [Native Query](/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/custom-mutations.mdx).
- You can mutate data via the TypeScript connector using the Command Query Separation (CQS) pattern. Learn more
  [here](/business-logic/typescript.mdx).

:::tip Simple point-to-point mutations

Support for point-to-point mutations is coming soon! This will allow you to perform mutations directly on the database
via GraphQL.
