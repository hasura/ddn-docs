# GraphQL Mutations

Mutations are used to modify data in the database. They are analogous to the `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands in
SQL. Hasura provides a powerful and flexible GraphQL API to perform mutations.

## Next steps

You can mutate data via the TypeScript connector using the Command and Query Separation (CQS) pattern. Learn more
[here](/graphql-api/mutations/typescript.mdx).

:::tip Simple point-to-point mutations

Support for point-to-point mutations is coming soon! This will allow you to perform mutations directly on the database
via GraphQL.
