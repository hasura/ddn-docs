# GraphQL Mutations

Mutations are used to modify data in a database. They are analogous to the `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands in
SQL. Hasura provides a powerful and flexible GraphQL API to perform mutations.

## Next steps

Currently, you can perform mutations via the GraphQL API using the following methods:

- Some data connectors support mutations out-of-the-box and — when
  [adding `commands`](/cli/commands/ddn_command_add.mdx) will generate them automatically.
- You can mutate data via the TypeScript connector using the Command Query Separation (CQS) pattern. Learn more
  [here](/business-logic/typescript.mdx).
