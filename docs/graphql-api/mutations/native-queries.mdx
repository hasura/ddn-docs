# Native Queries

Native queries can be defined by adding them to the `"nativeQueries"` section of a connector. Each query is specified as
SQL. The return structure of the query must be explicitly specified in the `"columns"` field.

Native queries can take arguments using the `{{argument_name}}` syntax. Arguments must be specified along with their
type. The arguments are not interpolated, but provided to your data source as parameters, and therefore must be specific
values, not arbitrary SQL.

:::warning This feature is experimental and subject to change.

Native Query mutations can be defined the same way as regular Native Queries, with a few important tweaks:

1. The Native Query should include a field `isProcedure: true`.
2. The SQL should include a `RETURNING` clause, listing the returned columns (use `RETURNING *` to return all columns).

Here's an example which inserts into a table called `"Artist"`:

```yaml
metadata:
  tables: {}
  nativeQueries:
    insert_artist:
      isProcedure: true
      sql: INSERT INTO public."Artist" VALUES ({{id}}, {{name}}) RETURNING *
      columns:
        ArtistId:
          name: ArtistId
          type: int4
        Name:
          name: Name
          type: varchar
      arguments:
        id:
          name: id
          type: int4
        name:
          name: name
          type: varchar
```

This example can be used to insert a new artist:

```graphql
mutation {
  insert_artist(args: { id: 1, name: "Bob" }) {
    affected_rows
    returning {
      ArtistId
      Name
    }
  }
}
```

To expose a Native Query mutation via the GraphQL API, add them as a procedure
[command](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) to the Hasura metadata.

:::info Availability

Check your connector's documentation on the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors) to see if it supports native
queries.
