# Delete Data

## Update an object by a unique field

You can delete an object by targeting it using a unique key according to the source schema.

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`mutation DeletePost {
  deletePostsById(keyId: "6") {
    affectedRows
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "deletePostsById": {
      "affectedRows": 1
    }
  }
}`}
/>

## Custom delete mutations

For connectors that support native mutations, you can also create custom delete mutations to delete data in your data
source. This allows you to write any custom logic you need to delete data using your data source's native capabilities.

Learn more in your [connector's reference documentation](/reference/connectors/index.mdx).
