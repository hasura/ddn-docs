# GraphQL API

## Introduction

When you add a new data connector to Hasura, depending on the source and the abilities of the connector, you'll be able
to interact with your data or business logic easily with the power of GraphQL.

Documentation for data connectors can be found either in [the Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors) or in the
repo of each connector itself. With the data connector documentation, you'll be able to find which of the GraphQL
queries documented in this section are available to you.
