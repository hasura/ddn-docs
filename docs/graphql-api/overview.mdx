# Hasura GraphQL API: Overview

Hasura offers a GraphQL API tailored to your data domain. To set it up, you simply need to create a DDS object with the
type `modelGraphqlApi` corresponding to a model. Hasura takes care of auto-generating the GraphQL schema based on the
definitions of your data domain's models and types. Additionally, the `modelGraphqlApi` DDS object provides the
flexibility to customize specific aspects of your GraphQL schema. Using `scalarTypeGraphqlExpression` DDS object, you
can customize the comparison input objects for any data source's scalar types.
