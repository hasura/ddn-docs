# Basics

## Introduction

When you connect a source to Hasura DDN using a
[data connector](/data-sources/overview.mdx#how-do-i-connect-my-data-to-hasura-ddn) and generate Hasura metadata to
represent its resources, the source becomes accessible through a unified GraphQL API. The metadata lets you control how
the data is exposed and interacted with.

Every data connector supports querying and subscribing to data out-of-the-box. Some connectors also provide
auto-generated mutations for inserting, updating, or deleting data. For most connectors without auto-generated
mutations, you can define custom native mutations.

:::tip Check out connector docs

For questions about the capabilities of individual connectors, check out their
[reference docs](/reference/connectors/index.mdx).

:::

Queries, subscriptions, and mutations are exposed as root-level fields, enabling you to fetch, monitor, or modify data
directly through the GraphQL API.

The sections below explain how to interact with your data using the GraphQL API.
