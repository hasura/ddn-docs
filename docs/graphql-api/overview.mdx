# Hasura GraphQL API: Overview

Hasura offers a GraphQL API tailored to your data domain. To set it up, you simply need to create
a DDS object with the type `modelGraphqlApi` corresponding to a model. Hasura takes care of auto-generating
the GraphQL schema based on the definitions of your data domain's models and types. Additionally,
the `modelGraphqlApi` DDS object provides the flexibility to customize specific aspects of your GraphQL schema.
Using `scalarTypeGraphqlExpression` DDS object, you can customize the comparison input objects for any data source's
scalar types.
