# Core Concepts

The sprawl of microservices and APIs has led to a new set of challenges for developers and architects.

In the modern era of building applications, the data layer is becoming increasingly complex. The data layer is no longer
just a database, but a collection of databases, services, and APIs. Hasura v3 introduces the concept of a **data
supergraph** to help you manage this complexity.

## The state of the data layer

Imagine the following 30,000-foot view of a data layer for a hypothetical e-commerce application:

- A relational database for storing product information.
- A document database for storing user information.
- A search service for searching products.
- A payment service for processing payments.
- A shipping service for fulfilling orders.
- A vector database for storing user recommendations.

This isn't an uncommon scenario. In fact, it's quite common. The problem is that each of these data sources has its own
API, its own schema, and its own way of doing things. This makes it difficult to build applications that span multiple
data sources. It slows down development, takes a room full of architects to design, and requires a team of engineers to
maintain.

It makes it incredibly difficult to iterate and it slows teams down.

## Subgraphs

Each of the data sources in the above example is a **[subgraph](/ci-cd/subgraphs.mdx)**.

A subgraph is a graph of a single data source. While it's operable as an independent API, when combined with other
subgraphs, it becomes part of a larger data supergraph.

### How do you build a graph?

Subgraphs are connected to your data layer using a **[data connector](/connectors/overview.mdx)**. Hasura v3 ships with
a number of data connectors that work with popular databases, services, and APIs out-of-the-box; you can also build your
own. This saves you the time and effort of building and maintaining your own APIs to manage data sources and existing
microservices.

With each subgraph you add to your Hasura project, you're building a graph of your data layer. You can build as many
subgraphs as you need to represent your data layer. These subgraphs can even be custom business logic as TypeScript
functions that return or mutate data directly via your GraphQL API.

## Supergraph

A **data supergraph** is a graph of all your data sources. It represents all your data sources as a **_single_**,
consistent API. By aggregating all your data sources into a single API, you can build applications that span multiple
data sources without having to worry about the complexity of each individual data source. You can also deliver a single
API to your frontend developers, which makes it easier for them to build applications.

You can even enable individual teams to build and maintain their own subgraphs without having to worry about how those
subgraphs will be consumed by other teams. This allows you to scale your teams and your applications without having to
scale your architecture.

### How do you build a supergraph?

This happens automatically.

As you add subgraphs to your Hasura project, Hasura v3 automatically builds a supergraph of all your data sources. You
have the freedom and flexibility to define relationships across this supergraph, connecting data sources together in
ways that make sense for your application.
