# Get Support

## Introduction

### Hasura Support Portal

before filling out the form:

The more complete your description, the easier it will be to help you resolve your issue. Should you have the resources,
please attach any assets (such as screenshots or screen recordings) that may help a support representative assist you.

When your form is complete, click `Submit` to create your ticket.

### Email

Additionally, you can send an email to [support@hasura.io](mailto:support@hasura.io) with a description of the problem
using the following [guidelines](https://hasura.io/support/#support-priority-definitions) to aid us in setting
priorities.
