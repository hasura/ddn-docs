# Querying Models

## Introduction

The JSON:API implementation in Hasura DDN allows you to query your models using standard JSON:API conventions. This
section covers the basics of querying models and includes examples of common query patterns.

## Request Format

Fetch all resources from a model, including all fields.

```http
GET /v1/rest/<subgraph-name>/<model-name>
```

Fetch all resources from a model, but only include specific fields.

```http
GET /v1/rest/<subgraph-name>/<model-name>?fields[<model-object-type>]=<field1>,<field2>
```

Where:

- `subgraph-name`: Name of your subgraph (e.g., "default")
- `model-name`: Name of your model (e.g., "Articles", "Users")
- `model-object-type`: Name of your model's object type (e.g., "Article", "User")
- `field1`, `field2`: Comma-separated list of field names to include

## Examples

### Fetch all articles

Fetch all articles from the "Articles" model in the "default" subgraph.

Request:

```http
GET /v1/rest/default/Articles
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "Article",
      "id": "1",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Introduction to JSON:API",
        "content": "JSON:API is a specification for building APIs...",
        "created_at": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
        "author_id": 1
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Article",
      "id": "2",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Advanced JSON:API Concepts",
        "content": "In this article, we'll explore...",
        "created_at": "2023-01-02T12:00:00Z",
        "author_id": 2
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Select specific fields

Select the `title` and `content` fields from all articles in the "Articles" model in the "default" subgraph.

Request:

```http
GET /v1/rest/default/Articles?fields[Article]=title,content
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "Article",
      "id": "1",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Introduction to JSON:API",
        "content": "JSON:API is a specification for building APIs..."
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Article",
      "id": "2",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Advanced JSON:API Concepts",
        "content": "In this article, we'll explore..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Response Format

[Responses](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-resources-responses) follow the JSON:API specification format:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "User",
      "id": "1",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
