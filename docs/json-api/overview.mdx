# JSON:API Overview

## Introduction

Hasura DDN provides a JSON:API-compliant interface as an alternative to [GraphQL](/graphql-api/overview.mdx) for
accessing your data. This implementation adheres to the [JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org), offering a
standardized REST-based approach to interact with your resources.

When you connect a source to Hasura DDN using a [data connector](/data-sources/overview.mdx) and generate Hasura
metadata, the source becomes accessible through both GraphQL and JSON:API interfaces. Your Hasura metadata lets you
control how the data is exposed and interacted with across both APIs.

:::warning Alpha release

The JSON:API implementation in Hasura DDN is currently in alpha. While we aim to follow the JSON:API specification, some
features may be incomplete or differ from the standard. Check the documentation for the latest supported features.

### Benefits of JSON:API in Hasura DDN

1. **Automatic Generation**: JSON:API endpoints are automatically generated from your data models
2. **Unified Security**: Uses the same permission system as your GraphQL API
3. **Consistent Performance**: Benefits from Hasura's optimization engine
4. **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with your existing Hasura setup

## Getting Started

### Request Format

Every data connector supports querying through JSON:API out-of-the-box. To query your data, use the standard REST
endpoint structure:

```http
GET /v1/rest/<subgraph-name>/<model-name>
```

Example Request:

```http
GET /v1/rest/default/Articles
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "Article",
      "id": "1",
      "attributes": {
        "title": "Understanding JSON:API",
        "content": "A detailed guide..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
