# Basics

## Introduction

Hasura DDN provides a JSON:API-compliant interface as an alternative to [GraphQL](/graphql-api/overview.mdx) for
accessing your data. This implementation adheres to the [JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org), offering a
standardized REST-based approach to interact with your resources.

When you connect a source to Hasura DDN using a [data connector](/data-sources/overview.mdx) and generate Hasura
metadata, the source becomes accessible through both GraphQL and JSON:API interfaces. Your Hasura metadata lets you
control how the data is exposed and interacted with across both APIs.

JSON:API endpoints are automatically generated from your data models, providing a seamless way to interact with your
data without additional configuration. These endpoints use the same permission system as your GraphQL API, ensuring
unified security across both interfaces. Hasura's optimization engine enhances performance, making queries efficient and
scalable while maintaining a consistent experience. Since JSON:API support is built directly into Hasura DDN, it works
out-of-the-box with your existing setup.

:::warning Alpha release

The JSON:API implementation in Hasura DDN is currently in alpha. While we aim to follow the JSON:API specification, some
features may be incomplete or differ from the standard. Check the documentation for the latest supported features.
