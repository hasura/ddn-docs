# Introduction

Hasura supports connecting to a myriad of data sources. We call the component that connects Hasura to a data source a
**Native Data Connector (NDC)**, or simply "data connector".

## What is a data connector?

Plainly, a data connector is an HTTP service that exposes a set of APIs that Hasura uses to communicate with the data
source. The data connector is responsible for interpreting work to be done on behalf of the Hasura Engine, using the
native query language of the data source.

Data connectors, which are built using the [NDC Specification](http://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/) and closely integrated
with [Open DDS](https://github.com/hasura/open-data-domain-specification), enable anyone to create rich, highly-native
data sources.

## How does it work?

The NDC Specification defines a set of APIs that a data connector must implement. These APIs, which accept and return
JSON, are used by Hasura to communicate with the data connector. The NDC Specification also defines a set of metadata
that the data connector must provide to Hasura. This metadata is used by Hasura to introspect the data connector,
generate the GraphQL schema, and execute operations against the data source.

## What data connectors are available?

<!-- TODO: Remove information in this section if no v3 ndc-hub -->

Tons! We've developed and maintain a series of data connectors that allow you to connect to a variety of data sources.
These data connectors are built using the NDC Specification and are available in the
[NDC Hub](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub).

The NDC Hub also contains a list of community-built data connectors. You can also author your own data connector to
connect to a data source that is not supported by Hasura out of the box, or that isn't available in the NDC Hub.
