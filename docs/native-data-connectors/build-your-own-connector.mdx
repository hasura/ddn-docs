# Build Your Own Connector

You can build your own connector using one of our SDKs. Currently, we have the following available:

- [Rust Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub#rusk-sdk)

Alternatively, you can implement the NDC spec directly, or use the Typescript connector for simple functions and procedures.

## Example: CSV Connector - Direct NDC Spec Implementation

The NDC Specification documentation can be found [here](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/overview.html) and a guide,
based on developing a connector for CSVs, can be found [here](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/tutorial/index.html).
You can use this guide as a reference to build your own connector.

## Example: Sendgrid Connector - Rust SDK

An example of implementing the Sendgrid API can be found [on Github here](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/).

An overview of the architecture of the project can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/#sendgrid-connector).

It can be summarized as follows:

* The connector is designed to work via the [`hasura3 connector` plugin](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/hasura-cli/connector-plugin/) deployment method.
* As with all connector-plugin connectors, the connector is built and run as defined in its [Dockerfile](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/blob/main/Dockerfile)
  * The `Dockerfile` is a two-stage implementation
    * Stage 1
      - Installs system dependencies
      - Builds the Rust Cargo Project
    * Stage 2
      - Copies the relase build
      - Starts the server reading the configuration from `/config.json`
* The connector is implemented using the [Rust Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub#rusk-sdk)
  * The [`main` entrypoint](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/blob/main/crates/ndc-sendgrid/src/main.rs)
      uses the SDK's `default_main` method invoked with our `SendGridConnector` implementation of the `Connector` trait.
  * The most important aspects of this implementation are
    * Defining its `SendGridConfiguration` that includes its API Key.
    * Exposing its `/schema`
    * Providing a `/query` to list email templates
    * Providing a `/mutation` to send emails
  * The [SendGrid API interactions](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/blob/main/crates/ndc-sendgrid/src/sendgrid_api.rs) expose
    * `invoke_list_function_templates`, and
    * `invoke_send_mail`
* With all this in place the connector can be used by referencing [the repository](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid)
  `> hasura3 connector create sendgrid:v1 --github-repo-url https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/tree/main --volume ./sendgrid.connector.configuration.json:/config.json`
* The running connector can then be referenced in Hasura V3 Metadata
  * Leveraged by the LSP
  * Targeted by the engine
  * Recieve Translated GraphQL Queries
