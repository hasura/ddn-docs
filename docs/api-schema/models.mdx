The Hasura Data Domain Specification (DDS) is a key component of Hasura V3 that defines the metadata structure for the Hasura runtime engine. In Hasura V3, models are defined using the DDS, allowing you to create powerful and flexible APIs.

## Models
Models in Hasura V3 represent the tables or collections in your data sources. They provide a way to define the fields and relationships within each table or collection, enabling you to easily query and manipulate your data using GraphQL.

## Types
In Hasura V3, a model is defined using a type. A type represents the structure of your data and includes fields, relationships, and other metadata.

## What is a type?
A type in Hasura V3 is a representation of a table or collection in your data source. It defines the fields and relationships that can be queried or mutated.

## Hasura Data Domain Specification (DDS)
The Hasura Data Domain Specification (DDS) is the specification used to define the structure of models in Hasura V3. It provides a standardized way to describe the metadata for your data sources.

## Tooling
Hasura V3 provides a range of tooling to help you author models as per the DDS. This includes text editor plugins, a robust CLI, and a refactored console. These tools make it easier to create and manage your models using the DDS.

## Queries
Once you have defined your models using the DDS, you can use GraphQL queries to retrieve data from your data sources. Hasura V3 automatically generates GraphQL queries based on your models, making it easy to fetch data.

## Relationships
Relationships allow you to define connections between different models in Hasura V3. By establishing relationships, you can query related data across multiple tables or collections.

## "Same source" relationships
Hasura V3 supports "same source" relationships, which allow you to define relationships between tables or collections within the same data source. This enables you to query and manipulate related data efficiently.

## Global ID
In Hasura V3, each model is assigned a global ID, which uniquely identifies the model across all data sources. The global ID is used to reference models in relationships and queries.
