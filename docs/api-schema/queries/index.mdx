# GraphQL Queries

## Introduction

GraphQL queries are used to fetch data from a [model](/api-schema/models.mdx).

Hasura auto-generates queries as part of the GraphQL schema from your Open DDS model using
[`modelGraphqlApi`](/api-schema/queries/open-dds-reference.mdx#open-dds-reference-modelgraphqlapi) Open DDS object.

## Exploring queries

Let's take a look at the different queries you can run using the Hasura GraphQL API. We'll use examples based on
a typical author/article schema for reference.

- [Select Many queries](/api-schema/queries/select-many.mdx)
- [Select Uniques queries](/api-schema/queries/select-uniques.mdx)
