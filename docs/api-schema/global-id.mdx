# Hasura Global ID

A Global ID is a unique identifier that can be used to represent a specific resource across
different systems or databases. It combines a type-specific prefix with the resource's unique identifier to create a
globally unique identifier.

## Using Global ID in Hasura V3

Hasura V3 introduces the concept of Global ID to provide a standardized way of
representing resources in a distributed system. With Global ID, you can easily reference and identify resources across
different databases or systems.

## Benefits of Global ID

### Global Uniqueness

Global IDs ensure that each resource has a unique identifier across all systems, eliminating
conflicts and ensuring consistency.

### Portability

Global IDs can be used to reference resources across different
databases or systems without worrying about compatibility issues.

### Easy Integration

Global IDs simplify the integration of multiple systems by providing a common identifier format.

## Generating Global IDs in Hasura V3

Hasura V3 provides built-in support for generating Global IDs. When a resource is created, Hasura
automatically assigns a Global ID to it based on the resource's type and unique identifier.

## Retrieving Resources using Global ID

To retrieve a resource using its Global ID, you can use the Hasura API and specify the Global ID in your queries.
Hasura will handle the resolution and fetch the corresponding resource for you.

## Example Usage

Let's say you have a "users" table in your database. In Hasura V3, you can generate a Global ID for a
specific user by combining the type-specific prefix (e.g., "User:") with the user's unique identifier. The resulting
Global ID might look like "User:123".

To retrieve the user with the Global ID "User:123", you can make a query to the Hasura API, specifying the Global ID in
the appropriate field or parameter.

## Conclusion

Global ID in Hasura V3 provides a standardized and efficient way to represent and reference resources
across
different systems or databases. By leveraging Global IDs, you can ensure global uniqueness, portability, and easy
integration in your applications.

Please refer to the official Hasura V3 documentation for more in-depth information on working with Global IDs and other
features.
