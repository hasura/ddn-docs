# Open DDS Types

## Introduction

Open DDS let's you define types for your data domain. This is useful as you may
want flexibility in defining your types in the data domain which is decoupled
from the data types in your data source.

DDS uses a concrete type system with some primitive types and some user defined
types. All subsequent DDS layers (eg: operators, models, commands) are defined
in terms of these types.

The types can be one of the following:
- Primitives: `Int` / `Float` / `Boolean` / `String`
- Container types: `Nullable` and `Array`
- Custom types:
  - Type alias (called `NewType`)
  - Object type containing fields and values

## Description

Primitives types are self-explanatory.

Container types are types that can contain other types, primitive or custom.
Right now container types can be nullable or arrays. Nullability in your data
types are represented using this `Nullable` container type.

You can also define custom types. You can either alias existing types (primitive
or custom), or you can also define a type with fields. The fields can in turn be
primitive or other custom types.

## Primitive and Container Types

Primitive types don't have any metadata structure. You can just use the names
`Int` / `Float` / `Boolean` / `String` directly.

Container types are defined as -

```json
{
  "Nullable": <Type>
}
```

```json
{
  "Array": <Type>
}
```

- `Type`: String in case of primitive or custom types. An object in case of container types. (Link to JSONSchema of `Type`)

## NewType
In DDS, type aliasing can be done by defining DDS object of kind of `NewType`.
To define a `NewType` you need to define a name and an optional representation.
This `representation` field can refer to any existing primitive, container or
custom type. This can be string or object

### Metadata Structure

```json
{
    "kind": "newType",
    "name": <TypeName>,
    "representation": <Type>
}
```

- `TypeName`: Name of the type (in string)
- `Type`: String in case of primitive or custom types. An object in case of container types. (Link to JSONSchema of `Type`)

### Examples

```json
{
  "kind": "newType",
  "name": "UUID",
  "representation": "String"
}
```

```json
[
  {
    "kind": "newType",
    "name": "Tag",
    "representation": "String"
  },
  {
    "kind": "newType",
    "name": "Tags",
    "representation": {
      "Array": "Tag"
    }
  }
]
```

```json
{
  "kind": "newType",
  "name": "OpaqueDate"
}
```

## Object Types
In DDS, completely new types can be created by defining DDS object of kind of `objectType`. You need to define a name and fields of this type.

### Metadata Structure

```json
{
  "kind": "objectType",
  "name": <TypeName>,
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "field1",
      "type": <Type> 
    },
    {
      "name": "field2",
      "type": <Type>
    }
  ]
}
```

- `TypeName`: Name of the type (in string)
- `Type`: String in case of primitive or custom types. An object in case of container types. (Link to JSONSchema of `Type`)

### Examples

```json
{
  "kind": "objectType",
  "name": "author",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "author_id",
      "type": "Int"
    },
    {
      "name": "first_name",
      "type": "String"
    },
    {
      "name": "last_name",
      "type": "String"
    }
  ]
}
```
