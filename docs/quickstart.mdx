# Quickstart with Hasura DDN

In less than <em>a minute</em> and without needing a data source connection string, you can have a supergraph API
running locally and deployed on Hasura DDN. Check out the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsO6TzwFb30).

## Prerequisites

1. **Install the DDN CLI**

   <InstallTheCli />

2. **Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)** (needed for local development)

   The Docker based workflow helps you iterate and develop locally without deploying any changes to Hasura DDN, making
   the development experience faster and your feedback loops shorter. **You'll need Docker Compose `v2.20` or later.**

3. **Validate the installation**

   You can verify that the DDN CLI is installed correctly by running:

   <CodeBlock language="bash">{`ddn doctor`}</CodeBlock>

<Step
id="login"
language="bash"
code={`ddn auth login`}
heading={`Log in via the CLI`}
>

After you log in, the CLI will acknowledge your login and give you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

</Step>

<Step
id="supergraph-init"
language="bash"
code={'ddn supergraph init mysupergraph\ncd mysupergraph'}
heading={`Initialize a new supergraph in a new directory`}
>

Once you move into this new directory, you'll see your project's files scaffolded out for you by running `ls`.

</Step>

<Step
id="connector-init"
language="bash"
code={`ddn connector init my_connector -i`}
heading={`Connect to data`}
>

From the dropdown, choose the `hasura/postgres` data connector and connect to our sample PostgreSQL database using this
URL: `postgresql://read_only_user:readonlyuser@35.236.11.122:5432/v3-docs-sample-app`

</Step>

<Step
id="connector-introspect"
language="bash"
code={`ddn connector introspect my_connector`}
heading={`Introspect your data source`}
>

This will create Hasura metadata describing the schema of your data source. After running this, you should see tables
present in your `app/connector/my_connector/configuration.json` file, which you can open in your preferred editor.

</Step>

<Step
id="add-resources"
language="bash"
code={'ddn model add my_connector \'*\'\nddn command add my_connector \'*\'\nddn relationship add my_connector \'*\''}
heading={`Add your resources`}
>

Create metadata for [models](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx),
[commands](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx), and
[relationships](/reference/metadata-reference/relationships.mdx) in your supergraph. These define the structure,
operations, and connections within your supergraph and are generated as Hasura Metadata Language (HML) present in your
`app/metadata` directory.

</Step>

<Step
id="build-local"
language="bash"
code={`ddn supergraph build local`}
heading={`Build your supergraph`}
>

Create an immutable build of your supergraph and the local assets to run the engine. The build is stored as a set of
JSON files in `engine/build`.

</Step>

<Step
id="run-local"
language="bash"
code={`ddn run docker-start`}
heading={`Start your supergraph`}
>

Start your engine, connector, and other services. You can see a list of all running services using `docker ps`.

</Step>

<Step
id="open-local-console"
language="bash"
code={`ddn console --local`}
heading={`Open the console`}
>

In a new terminal tab open to the project's directory, open the console â€” Hasura DDN's GUI â€” so you can test out your
API.

</Step>

<Step
id="local-query"
language="graphql"
code={`query UsersAndOrders{
  users {
    id
    name
    email
    orders {
      id 
      created_at
      status
    }
  }
}
`}
heading={`Query your data`}
>

Execute this query via your console. You'll see a list of all users and their orders returned!

</Step>

<Step
id="project-init"
language="bash"
code={`ddn project init`}
heading={`Create a Hasura DDN project`}
>

Provision a new project on Hasura DDN, which serves as the deployment environment for your supergraph. Once complete,
the CLI will return the project's name.

</Step>

<Step
id="build-create"
language="bash"
code={`ddn supergraph build create`}
heading={`Build and deploy your supergraph`}
>

When this process is complete, the CLI will return a link to the hosted API where you can run the same query as before.

**That's it! you've created your very first, fully-functioning supergraph and deployed it to Hasura DDN ðŸŽ‰**

</Step>

## Next steps

What we've laid out above is the quickest way to get started with Hasura DDN. However, you have complete, granular
control over each step in the process and can extend and customize your supergraph to fit your teams' needs. After
deploying your first supergraph, take your next steps with Hasura DDN ðŸ‘‡
