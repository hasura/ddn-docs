# Quickstart with Hasura DDN

<div className="flex flex-col gap-6 mb-10">
  <div className="">

    <p className="text-[1.3rem]">
      In less than <em>a minute</em> and without needing a data source connection string, you can have a supergraph API
      running locally and deployed on Hasura DDN. 🚀{" "}

## Prerequisites

1. **Install the DDN CLI**

   <InstallTheCli />

2. **Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)** (needed for local development)

   The Docker based workflow helps you iterate and develop locally without deploying any changes to Hasura DDN, making
   the development experience faster and your feedback loops shorter. **You'll need Docker Compose `v2.27.1` or later.**

3. **Validate the installation**

   You can verify that the DDN CLI is installed correctly by running:

   <CodeBlock language="bash">{`ddn doctor`}</CodeBlock>

<Step
id="login"
language="bash"
code={`ddn auth login`}
heading={`Log in via the CLI`}
>

Authenticate your CLI session, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources. After you log in, the CLI will acknowledge
your login and check for any updates.

</Step>

<Step
id="supergraph-init"
language="bash"
code={'ddn supergraph init mysupergraph\ncd mysupergraph'}
heading={`Initialize a new supergraph in a new directory`}
>

Initialize a new local project by setting up all necessary files and directories for development in the new
`mysupergraph` directory. Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you.

</Step>

<Step
id="connector-init"
language="bash"
code={`ddn connector init my_connector -i`}
heading={`Connect to data`}
>

Add a new data connector to your supergraph project. From the dropdown, choose the `hasura/postgres` connector and
connect to our sample PostgreSQL database using this URL:
`postgresql://read_only_user:readonlyuser@35.236.11.122:5432/v3-docs-sample-app`

</Step>

<Step
id="connector-introspect"
language="bash"
code={`ddn connector introspect my_connector`}
heading={`Introspect your data source`}
>

Introspect the data source to create Hasura metadata describing the schema and its structure. After running this, you
should see tables present in your `app/connector/my_connector/configuration.json` file.

</Step>

<Step
id="add-resources"
language="bash"
code={'ddn model add my_connector \'*\'\nddn command add my_connector \'*\'\nddn relationship add my_connector \'*\''}
heading={`Add your resources`}
>

Create metadata for [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx), [commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx), and
[relationships](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx) in your supergraph. These define the structure, operations, and
connections within your supergraph and are generated as Hasura Metadata Language (HML) present in your `app/metadata`
directory.

</Step>

<Step
id="build-local"
language="bash"
code={`ddn supergraph build local`}
heading={`Build your supergraph`}
>

Create an immutable build of your supergraph and the local assets to run the engine. The build is stored as a set of
JSON files in `engine/build`.

</Step>

<Step
id="run-local"
language="bash"
code={`ddn run docker-start`}
heading={`Start your supergraph`}
>

Start your engine, connector, and other services. You can see a list of all running services using `docker ps`.

</Step>

<Step
id="open-local-console"
language="bash"
code={`ddn console --local`}
heading={`Open the console`}
>

In a new terminal tab open to the project's directory, open the console — Hasura DDN's GUI — so you can test out your
API.

</Step>

<Step
id="local-query"
language="graphql"
code={`query UsersAndOrders{
  users {
    id
    name
    email
    orders {
      id 
      created_at
      status
    }
  }
}
`}
heading={`Query your data`}
>

Execute this query via your console. You'll see a list of all users and their orders returned!

</Step>

<Step
id="project-init"
language="bash"
code={`ddn project init`}
heading={`Create a Hasura DDN project`}
>

Provision a new project on Hasura DDN, which serves as the deployment environment for your supergraph. Once complete,
the CLI will return the project's name.

</Step>

<Step
id="build-create"
language="bash"
code={`ddn supergraph build create`}
heading={`Build and deploy your supergraph`}
>

Create a cloud build of your supergraph and its connector. When this process is complete, the CLI will return a link to
the hosted API where you can run the same query as before.

**That's it! you've created your very first, fully-functioning supergraph and deployed it to Hasura DDN 🎉**

</Step>

## Next steps

What we've laid out above is the quickest way to get started with Hasura DDN. However, you have complete, granular
control over each step in the process and can extend and customize your supergraph to fit your teams' needs. After
deploying your first supergraph, take your next steps with Hasura DDN 👇
