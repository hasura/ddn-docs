        When you add a new data connector to Hasura, depending on the source and the abilities of the connector, you'll
        be able to interact with your data or business logic easily with the power of REST.
      </p>
      <p>
        Documentation for data connectors can be found either in the{" "}
        <a href="https://hasura.io/connectors">Connector Hub</a> or in the repo of each connector itself. With the data
        connector documentation, you'll be able to find which of the REST queries documented in this section are
        available to you.
      </p>
      <p>Hasura supports only queries at this stage, with mutations and subscriptions coming soon.</p>
