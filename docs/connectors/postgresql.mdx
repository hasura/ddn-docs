# Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL

The Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL is our flagship connector, with rich support for all kinds of queries.

:::tip Flavors of PostgreSQL

This connector works with most flavors of PostgreSQL — such as Yugabyte and Aurora — but has not been tested with all.
If you are looking for a connector for a specific flavor of PostgreSQL, you can search the
[Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors) or [build your own](/connectors/build-your-own-connector.mdx).

:::

## Configuration

:::warning Subject to change

During this active development phase, the configuration structure is subject to change.

:::

The connector will create an empty configuration as follows:

```yaml
---
version: 1
connectionUri:
  uri: ""
metadata:
  tables: {}
  nativeQueries: {}
  aggregateFunctions: {}
  comparisonOperators: {}
```

Once you enter your connection string for a PostgreSQL database and refresh your data source using the
[Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura), the `"tables"` and
`"aggregate_functions"` sections will be auto-populated based on the current state of the database.

These will always be regenerated from scratch.

### PostgreSQL connection URI

The PostgreSQL database URL should follow the [PostgreSQL connection URI form][libpq: Connection Strings], which looks
like this:

```
postgresql://[user[:password]@][host[:port]][/dbname][?param1=value2&param2=value2&...]
```

Remember to encode any ambiguous characters using standard URI encoding. For example, if you have an `@` in your
username, it will need to be written as `%40`.

## Scalar types

SQL data types are mapped to GraphQL types. The current mappings are as follows:

| SQL data type | GraphQL type |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| `bool`        | `Boolean`    |
| `int2`        | `Int`        |
| `int4`        | `Int`        |
| `int8`        | `Int`        |
| `float4`      | `Float`      |
| `float8`      | `Float`      |
| `numeric`     | `Float`      |
| `char`        | `String`     |
| `varchar`     | `String`     |
| `text`        | `String`     |
| `uuid`        | `String`     |
| `date`        | `String`     |
| `time`        | `String`     |
| `timestamp`   | `String`     |
| `timestamptz` | `String`     |
| `timetz`      | `String`     |

Other SQL scalar types are unsupported, but may still work in certain situations.

:::info Data type aliases

Note that many of these SQL data types have aliases in PostgreSQL, which can be found in the [PostgreSQL documentation
on data types][PostgreSQL: data types].

## Nested types

The connector does not currently support nested data structures, such as `array`, `hstore`, `json`, or `jsonb`, though
they may still work in certain situations.

## Queries

The connector supports all query operations; see the [query documentation](/graphql-api/queries/index.mdx) for details.

### Predicates

The `_is_null` operator checks whether a value is `NULL`.

The following binary operators are supported when filtering:

| Name                       | GraphQL operator | PostgreSQL operator | GraphQL types |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| equals                     | `_eq`            | `=`                 | all           |
| not equals                 | `_neq`           | `<>`                | all           |
| less than                  | `_lt`            | `<`                 | all           |
| less than or equal to      | `_lte`           | `<=`                | all           |
| greater than               | `_gt`            | `>`                 | all           |
| greater than or equal to   | `_gte`           | `>=`                | all           |
| like                       | `_like`          | `LIKE`              | `String`      |
| not like                   | `_nlike`         | `NOT LIKE`          | `String`      |
| case-insensitive like      | `_ilike`         | `ILIKE`             | `String`      |
| not case-insensitive like  | `_nilike`        | `NOT ILIKE`         | `String`      |
| similar                    | `_similar`       | `SIMILAR TO`        | `String`      |
| not similar                | `_nsimilar`      | `NOT SIMILAR TO`    | `String`      |
| regex                      | `_regex`         | `~`                 | `String`      |
| not regex                  | `_nregex`        | `!~`                | `String`      |
| case-insensitive regex     | `_iregex`        | `~`                 | `String`      |
| not case-insensitive regex | `_niregex`       | `!~`                | `String`      |

The `_not`, `_and`, and `_or` operators all work as usual.

## Mutations

The connector supports [mutations via Native Queries](/graphql-api/mutations/native-queries.mdx).
