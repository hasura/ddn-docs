# Deploy a Data Connector

## Deploy a connector to Hasura DDN

You can deploy any [verified connector](/connectors/hub.mdx#verifying-your-connector) available on the
[Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors) to Hasura DDN using the CLI.

### Step 1: Create a new connector manifest

To create a new connector manifest, run the following in a project directory:

```bash
ddn add connector-manifest <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph-name> --hub-connector <connector_name_and_version> --type cloud
```

| Argument                       | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<connector-name>`             | Whatever name you would like to assign to this connector.     |
| `<subgraph-name>`              | The name of the subgraph to which the connector belongs.      |
| `<connector_name_and_version>` | The name and version of the connector from the Connector Hub. |
| `--type`                       | The type of connector. In this case, it's `cloud`.            |

You'll then need to add the connection URI for your connector's data source in the `.local.yaml` file for the project:

```yaml
<SUBGRAPH_NAME>_<CONNECTOR_NAME>_CONNECTION_URI: <CONNECTION_URI>
```

### Step 2: Build and deploy the connector

You can then build and deploy your connector to Hasura DDN using the following command with the appropriate values from
the previous step:

```bash
ddn build connector <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph-name>
```

## Test a connector locally

Both verified and non-verified connectors can be built and served locally for testing. This enables rapid feedback loops
as you don't have to worry about deploying to any external infrastructure.

### Step 1: Create a new connector manifest

```bash
ddn add connector-manifest <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph-name> --hub-connector <connector_name_and_version> --type local
```

| Argument                       | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<connector-name>`             | Whatever name you would like to assign to this connector.     |
| `<subgraph-name>`              | The name of the subgraph to which the connector belongs.      |
| `<connector_name_and_version>` | The name and version of the connector from the Connector Hub. |
| `--type`                       | The type of connector. In this case, it's `local`.            |

You'll then need to add the connection URI for your connector's data source in the `.local.yaml` file for the project:

```yaml
<SUBGRAPH_NAME>_<CONNECTOR_NAME>_CONNECTION_URI: <CONNECTION_URI>
```

### Step 2: Build and serve the connector

You can then build and serve your connector using the following command with the appropriate values from the previous
step:

```bash
ddn build connector <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph-name>
```

:::info deploying to your own infrastructure

If you'd prefer to deploy a connector to your own infrastructure, you can follow the steps for
[local testing](#test-a-connector-locally). This generates a Docker image which you can then deploy and build anywhere
Docker containers can be hosted.

In your manifest, simply update the `type` to `endpoints` and pass in the address of the hosted service.
