# Deploy a Data Connector

## Deploy a connector to Hasura DDN

You can deploy any verified connector available on the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors) to Hasura DDN using
the CLI.

### Step 1: Initialize a new connector

To initialize a new connector, run the following in a project directory:

```bash
ddn connector init <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph.yaml> -i
```

| Argument           | Description                                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<connector-name>` | Whatever name you would like to assign to this connector.               |
| `<subgraph.yaml>`  | Path to the config file of the subgraph to which the connector belongs. |

You'll then need to choose the connector type and provide and env vars required by the connector, e.g. database
connection urls.

:::info Some connectors don't require any env vars

An example of this would be the Node.js Lambda TypeScript connector.

### Step 2: Introspect the connector data source

If your connector has an upstream data source, e.g. a Postgres database for the hasura/postgres connector, update the
connector configuration by introspecting the data source.

```bash
ddn connector introspect <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph.yaml>
```

| Argument           | Description                                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<connector-name>` | Whatever name you would like to assign to this connector.               |
| `<subgraph.yaml>`  | Path to the config file of the subgraph to which the connector belongs. |

### Step 3: Build and deploy the connector

You can then build and deploy your connector to Hasura DDN using the following command with the appropriate values from
the previous step:

```bash
ddn connector build create --connector <connector.yaml> --project <project-name>
```

| Argument           | Description                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `<connector.yaml>` | Path to connector config file. |
| `<project>`        | DDN project to deploy to       |
