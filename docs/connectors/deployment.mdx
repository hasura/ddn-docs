# Deploy a Data Connector

## Deploy a connector to Hasura DDN

You can deploy any verified connector available on the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors) to Hasura DDN using
the CLI.

### Step 1: Initialize a new connector

To initialize a new connector, run the following in a project directory:

```bash
ddn connector init <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph-name> --hub-connector <connector>  --supergraph <supergraph.yaml>
```

| Argument            | Description                                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<connector-name>`  | Whatever name you would like to assign to this connector.             |
| `<subgraph-name>`   | The name of the subgraph to which the connector belongs.              |
| `<connector>`       | The connector from the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors). |
| `<supergraph.yaml>` | Path to supergraph config file                                        |

You'll then need to add the connection URI for your connector's data source in the `.env` file of the connector:

For example:
```env
CONNECTION_URI=<CONNECTION_URI>
```

:::info Some connectors don't require any connection URIs

An example of this would be the Node.js Lambda TypeScript connector.

:::

### Step 2: Build and deploy the connector

You can then build and deploy your connector to Hasura DDN using the following command with the appropriate values from
the previous step:

```bash
ddn connector build create --connector <connector.yaml> --project <project-name>
```
| Argument           | Description                    |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| `<connector.yaml>` | Path to connector config file. |
| `<project>`        | DDN project to deploy to       |
