# Deploy a Data Connector

## Deploy a connector to Hasura DDN

You can deploy any verified connector available on the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors) to Hasura DDN using
the CLI.

### Step 1: Create a new connector manifest

To create a new connector manifest, run the following in a project directory:

```bash
ddn add connector-manifest <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph-name> --hub-connector <connector> --type cloud
```

| Argument           | Description                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<connector-name>` | Whatever name you would like to assign to this connector.             |
| `<subgraph-name>`  | The name of the subgraph to which the connector belongs.              |
| `<connector>`      | The connector from the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors). |
| `--type`           | The type of connector. In this case, it's `cloud`.                    |

You'll then need to add the connection URI for your connector's data source in the `base.env.yaml` file for the project:

```yaml
<SUBGRAPH_NAME>_<CONNECTOR_NAME>_CONNECTION_URI: <CONNECTION_URI>
```

:::info Some connectors don't require any connection URIs

An example of this would be the Node.js Lambda TypeScript connector.

:::

### Step 2: Build and deploy the connector

You can then build and deploy your connector to Hasura DDN using the following command with the appropriate values from
the previous step:

```bash
ddn build connector <connector-name> --subgraph <subgraph-name>
```
