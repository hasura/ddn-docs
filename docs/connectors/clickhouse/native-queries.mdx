# Native Queries

## Introduction

This connector supports native queries: writing raw SQL queries to treat as collections (virtual tables)

This is an alternative to writing views on the database, which is usually preferable, but may not be plausible. This can
also be useful to iterate on views before creating them on the database.

:::warning Remote relationships

Parameterized native queries cannot be queried through remote relationships. Use
[ClickHouse Parameterized Views](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/view#parameterized-view)
instead.

## Writing native queries

You can create SQL queries for your connector by writing them in `.sql` files and storing them within your configuration
directory, usually organized in a specific subdirectory for better structure.

**Requirements**:

- Each `.sql` file should contain only a single SQL statement to maintain clarity and modularity.
- When specifying arguments in your SQL queries, use the
  [ClickHouse parameter syntax](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/interfaces/cli#cli-queries-with-parameters-syntax) to
  dynamically insert values.

**Example**:

Here's an example of a `.sql` file named `ArtistByName.sql` that retrieves artist data by name from the database:

```sql
-- queries/ArtistByName.sql
SELECT *
FROM "default"."Artist"
WHERE "Artist"."Name" = {ArtistName: String}
```

### Configuring queries in JSON

After creating your SQL query file, you need to define it in your `configuration.json` file. This involves specifying
the file path and the expected return type of the query.

Here is how you might add the `ArtistByName.sql` query to your configuration.json:

```json
{
  "tables": {},
  "queries": {
    "Name": {
      "exposed_as": "collection",
      "file": "queries/ArtistByName.sql",
      "return_type": {
        "kind": "definition",
        "columns": {
          "ArtistId": "Int32",
          "Name": "String"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Determining return types

To accurately define the return type in your JSON configuration, you can use the
[ClickHouse `toTypeName`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/other-functions#totypenamex) function
to inspect the types of columns returned by your query.

This SQL snippet can help you determine the column types by executing your query and applying the `toTypeName` function:

```sql
SELECT * APPLY toTypeName
FROM (
 -- your SQL here
) q LIMIT 1;
```

### Using table references

If your query's return type matches an existing table schema, and you prefer to reference the table directly in your
schema, you can do so by specifying it in your `configuration.json`.

This configuration links the `ArtistByName` query directly to the `Artist` table's schema:

```json
{
  "tables": {
    "Artist": {
      "name": "Artist",
      "schema": "default",
      "comment": "",
      "primary_key": {
        "name": "ArtistId",
        "columns": ["ArtistId"]
      },
      "return_type": {
        "kind": "definition",
        "columns": {
          "ArtistId": "Int32",
          "Name": "Nullable(String)"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "queries": {
    "Name": {
      "exposed_as": "collection",
      "file": "queries/ArtistByName.sql",
      "return_type": {
        "kind": "table_reference",
        "table_name": "Artist"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
