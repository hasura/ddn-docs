# Native Queries

This connector supports native queries: writing raw SQL queries to treat as collections (virtual tables)

This is an alternative to writing views on the database, which is usually preferable, but may not be plausible. This can
also be useful to iterate on views before creating them on the database.

:::warning Remote relationships

Parameterized native queries cannot be queried through remote relationships.
Use [ClickHouse Parameterized Views](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/view#parameterized-view) instead.

:::

You can write a native query as a `.sql` file in your configuration directory, typically in a dedicated subdirectory

Your file may only contain a single statement.

Arguments may be specified using the
[clickhouse parameter syntax](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/interfaces/cli#cli-queries-with-parameters-syntax)

```sql
-- queries/ArtistByName.sql
SELECT *
FROM "default"."Artist"
WHERE "Artist"."Name" = {ArtistName: String}
```

Then add the query to your `configuration.json` file. You'll need to figure out the query return type

```json
{
  "tables": {},
  "queries": {
    "Name": {
      "exposed_as": "collection",
      "file": "queries/ArtistByName.sql",
      "return_type": {
        "kind": "definition",
        "columns": {
          "ArtistId": "Int32",
          "Name": "String"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To figure out your return type, you can use the
[ClickHouse `toTypeName` function](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/other-functions#totypenamex)

One way to get the return types for your SQL statemen:

```sql
SELECT * APPLY toTypeName
FROM (
    -- your SQL here
) q LIMIT 1;

```

Alternatively, if your query returns the same type as another table, and you want this reflected in your schema:

```json
{
  "tables": {
    "Artist": {
      "name": "Artist",
      "schema": "default",
      "comment": "",
      "primary_key": {
        "name": "ArtistId",
        "columns": ["ArtistId"]
      },
      "return_type": {
        "kind": "definition",
        "columns": {
          "ArtistId": "Int32",
          "Name": "Nullable(String)"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "queries": {
    "Name": {
      "exposed_as": "collection",
      "file": "queries/ArtistByName.sql",
      "return_type": {
        "kind": "table_reference",
        "table_name": "Artist"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
