# Native Mutations

## Introduction

Native Mutations allow you to run custom mutations on your MongoDB database using the
[runCommand](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.runCommand) API. This allows you to run mutations
that are not supported by Hasura DDN's GraphQL engine.

This unlocks the full power of your database and the
[runCommand](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.runCommand) API, allowing you to run complex
pipelines, and mutations â€” all directly from your Hasura GraphQL API.

You can check out [Native Mutations](/connectors/mongodb/native-mutations/intro-and-setup.mdx) here.
