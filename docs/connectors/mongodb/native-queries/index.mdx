# Native Queries

## Introduction

Native queries are named MongoDB [aggregation pipelines][MongoDB: pipeline] that you specify in the data connector
configuration. They are similar to a database view, but more expressive as they admit parameters similar to a function
and do not require any DDL permissions on the database. See the configuration reference on [Native
Queries](/connectors/mongodb/config.mdx#updating-with-introspection).

## Types of Native Queries

You can check out examples of the different types of native queries below:
