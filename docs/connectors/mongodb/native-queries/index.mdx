# Native Queries

## Introduction

Native queries are enabled via MongoDB's [aggregation pipelines][MongoDB: pipeline], and are defined in the
MongoDB data connector's configuration. They are similar to a view but more expressive as they allow parameters
similar to functions and do not require any DDL permissions on the database. See the configuration reference on
[Native Queries](/connectors/mongodb/config.mdx#updating-with-introspection).

## Types of Native Queries

You can check out examples of the different types of native queries below:
