# Native Procedures

## Introduction

Native Procedures allow you to run custom SQL queries and/or mutations on your MongoDB database using the
[runCommand](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.runCommand) API. This allows you to run queries
and/or mutations that are not supported by Hasura DDN's GraphQL engine. This unlocks the full power of your database and
the [runCommand](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.runCommand) API, allowing you to run complex
pipelines, and mutations â€” all directly from your Hasura GraphQL API.
