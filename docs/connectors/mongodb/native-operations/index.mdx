# Native Operations

## Introduction

Native Operations in MongoDB, encompassing both Native Queries and Native Mutations, offer powerful enhancements to
database interactions through Hasura. Native Queries, configured via MongoDB's aggregation pipelines, function similarly
to views but with greater expressiveness, supporting parameters like functions without requiring any Data Definition
Language (DDL) permissions. These queries are highly configurable, as detailed in the MongoDB data connector's
configuration reference.

Native Mutations, on the other hand, leverage the
[runCommand](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.runCommand) API to execute custom mutations that
extend beyond the capabilities of Hasura DDN's GraphQL engine. This integration enables the execution of complex
pipelines and mutations directly from the GraphQL API, fully harnessing the potential of MongoDB's advanced
functionalities.

Together, these Native Operations unlock comprehensive and flexible database management within your supergraph.
