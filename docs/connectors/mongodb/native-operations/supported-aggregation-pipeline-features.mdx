# Supported aggregation pipeline features 

Native queries use [aggregation pipelines][] as the format for custom MongoDB queries. Native query configurations must
include type declarations for inputs and outputs for the native query's pipeline. The DDN CLI is able to type check
aggregation pipelines to write type declarations automatically (see [Manage native queries with the DDN CLI][]). But
this feature is in beta, and only supports a subset of aggregation pipeline features.

[Manage native queries with the DDN CLI]: ./native-queries.mdx#manage-native-queries-with-the-ddn-cli

## Supported pipeline stages

An aggregation pipeline is a list of [aggregation stages][] that each filter, transform, or sort documents that flow
through them. Hasura's experimental pipeline type inference currently supports these stages:

[aggregation stages]: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/

- [x] `$documents`
- [x] `$match`
- [x] `$sort`
- [x] `$skip`
- [x] `$limit`
- [x] `$group`
- [x] `$project`
- [x] `$replaceRoot`
- [x] `$replaceWith`
- [x] `$unwind`

## Supported query predicate operators

Certain stages, such as `$match`, use a specific format called a **query predicate**. These are not general purpose
expressions - they are specialized for determining a match against an input document. Hasura's experimental pipeline
type inference currently supports these query predicate operators:

- [x] `$and` / `$or` / `$nor`
- [x] `$not`
- [x] `$elemMatch`
- [x] `$eq` / `$ne` / `$gt` / `$lt` / `$gte` / `$lte`
- [x] `$in` / `$nin`
- [x] `$exists`
- [x] `$expr`
- [x] `$type`
- [x] `$mod`
- [x] `$all`
- [x] `$size`

## Supported aggregation expression operators

Aggregation pipelines use **aggregation expressions** to reference document values, or to express logic. Note that these
are not the operators typically used in the `$match` stage, but you do see these in, for example, `$replaceWith` and
`$project` stages.

Hasura's experimental pipeline type inference currently supports the aggregation expression operators indicated below.
Operators with a check mark are supported. Other without a check mark are not supported yet.
