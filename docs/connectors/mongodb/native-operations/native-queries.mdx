# Native Queries

## Introduction

Native Queries allow you to run custom aggregation pipelines on your MongoDB database. This allows you to run queries
that are not supported by Hasura's GraphQL engine.

## Setup

Native Queries can be defined by

1. Adding a `native_queries` directory if one doesn't already exist in your connector configuration directory
2. Adding a .json file following the syntax laid out in the following sections.

Native Queries can take arguments using the `"{{argument_name}}"` syntax. Arguments must be specified along with their
type.

## Example

Here's an example of simple `"hello"` Native Query:

### Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "hello",
  "representation": "function",
  "description": "Basic test of native queries",
  "arguments": {
    "name": { "type": { "scalar": "string" } }
  },
  "resultDocumentType": "Hello",
  "objectTypes": {
    "Hello": {
      "fields": {
        "__value": { "type": { "scalar": "string" } }
      }
    }
  },
  "pipeline": [
    {
      "$documents": [
        {
          "__value": "{{ name }}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This will create a query called `"hello"` which takes a single argument called `"name"` of type `string`. The query will
return an object with the key `"__value"` and the value of the argument `"hello"`.

### Usage

With the example above, you can then use the query in your GraphQL API like this:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  hello(name: "world") {
    __value
  }
}
```
