# Configuration

:::warning Subject to change

During this active development phase, the configuration structure is subject to change.

:::

## Introduction

This document is the reference documentation for the MongoDB data connector configuration. Configuration is broken down
into 3 folders currently.
1. [`schema`](#schema)
2. [`native_queries`](#native-queries)
3. [`native_procedures`](#native-procedures)

### Schema

The `schema` directory contains json files of all the collections that were introspected in your database.

**Example**

```json
{
  "name": "users",
  "collections": {
    "users": {
      "type": "users"
    }
  },
  "objectTypes": {
    "users": {
      "fields": {
        "_id": {
          "type": {
            "scalar": "objectId"
          }
        },
        "email": {
          "type": {
            "scalar": "string"
          }
        },
        "name": {
          "type": {
            "scalar": "string"
          }
        },
        "password": {
          "type": {
            "scalar": "string"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Name

Specifies the name that gets exposed to Hasura metadata/tooling.

```json
{
  "name": "users"
}
```

#### Collections

Contains definitions of the collection name in your database and the object type it returns

```json
{
  "collections": {
    "users": {
      "type": "users"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Object types

Defines the returned object types. Object types contain `fields` that specify either scalar or other structural object
types.

```json
{
  "objectTypes": {
    "users": {
      "fields": {
        "_id": {
          "type": {
            "scalar": "objectId"
          }
        },
        "email": {
          "type": {
            "scalar": "string"
          }
        },
        "name": {
          "type": {
            "scalar": "string"
          }
        },
        "password": {
          "type": {
            "scalar": "string"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Native queries

Native queries are named MongoDB [aggregation pipelines][MongoDB: pipeline] that you specify in the data connector
configuration. They are similar to a database view, but more expressive as they admit parameters similar to a function
and do not require any DDL permissions on the database. See the configuration reference on [Native
Queries](#updating-with-introspection).

More information in the [Native Queries](/connectors/mongodb/native-queries) documention.

### Native procedures

Native procedures are named MongoDB [runCommand][MongoDB: runCommand] operations that you specify in the data connector
configuration. These are commonly used for mutations, but we do support the full [runCommand][MongoDB: runCommand] API.
See the configuration reference on [Native Procedures](#updating-with-introspection).

More information in the [Native Procedures](/connectors/mongodb/native-procedures/index.mdx) documentation.

## Configuration workflows

The data connector provides a plugin to the hasura CLI to assist you in authoring configuration.

We provide the `mongodb-cli-plugin`, which is a small executable whose, builds can be accessed [here](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-mongodb/releases/).

:::warning Current status

The intended way to commonly use this plugin is through the main `ddn` CLI.

But at the time of this writing this part of the developer experience is undergoing active development, so the exact
command invocations are likely to be different from what is described here.

Therefore this document will give workflow descriptions using the data connector CLI plugin directly. This is likely to
change in the near future.
:::

### Updating with introspection {#updating-with-introspection}

Whenever the schema of your database changes you will need to update your data connector configuration accordingly to
reflect those changes.

Running `mongodb-cli-plugin update` in a directory will do the following:

Connect to the database with the specified `connection-uri`, create a `schema` directory if one does not exist, and then
either create or update a file for each collection that is introspected in your database.

Currently `mongodb-cli-plugin` tries use any validation schemas if they exist, and falls back to sampling documents in
your collection. The current sample size is 10. This will be configurable in future releases.

### Manually editing

There are occasions when the automatic introspection falls short of your needs. For instance, it may not detect a
particular entity type, or it may pick names according to conventions you disagree with.

:::note
This only applies to the files under the `schema` directory
:::

If you find yourself in this situation you may still be able to bring your configuration into an acceptable state by
editing it manually. In this case you'd be well advised to keep your configuration files under version control, as
re-running the `update` command will overwrite your manually-crafted changes.

[Native Queries](/connectors/mongodb/native-queries) and [Native Procedures](/connectors/mongodb/native-procedures) will
always need manual authorship currently. We plan on improving this authorship flow in the future.
