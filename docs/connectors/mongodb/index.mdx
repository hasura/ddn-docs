# Native Data Connector for MongoDB

## Introduction

The MongoDB Native Data Connector for Hasura DDN expands our connectivity options, enabling integration with
MongoDB noSQL databases. Here we'll provide an overview of the features offered by the MongoDB connector and guide
you through the configuration process within a Hasura DDN project.

The MongoDB data connector makes any database resource listed in its configuration available. In order to populate
the configuration, the connector supports introspecting the database via the Hasura CLI `update` command.

## Queryable collections

The MongoDB data connector supports several types of queryable collections:

- Tables
- Views
- Native queries
- Native mutations

**Tables and views** are typically discovered automatically during the introspection process.

**Native queries** are enabled via MongoDB's [aggregation pipelines][MongoDB: pipeline], and are defined in the
MongoDB data connector's configuration. They are similar to a view but more expressive as they allow parameters
similar to functions and do not require any DDL permissions on the database. See the configuration reference on
[Native Queries](/connectors/mongodb/native-queries).

**Native mutations** in MongoDB are enabled via a [runCommand][MongoDB: runCommand] and are also defined in the
MongoDB data connector's configuration. These are commonly used for simple data mutations, but we do support the
full [runCommand][MongoDB: runCommand] API too. See the configuration reference on
[Native Mutations](/connectors/mongodb/native-mutations).

## Data types

The Hasura MongoDB data connector supports any data type that MongoDB knows how encode and decode as JSON - No data
type is handled as a special case.

### Data type naming

Many data types have aliases in MongoDB, which can be found in the
[MongoDB documentation on data types][MongoDB: data types].

In order to use standard GraphQL data types rather than custom data types in the resulting GraphQL schema, the
Hasura supergraph configuration enables expressing a mapping between data connector types and GraphQL types.

### BSON support

MongoDB stores data in BSON, while the GraphQL API uses JSON. Hasura converts query responses to JSON according to the
types defined in the Hasura schema configuration. For example,

- `double` and `int` (64-bit floating-point numbers, and 32-bit integers) are converted to JSON numbers
- `long` and `decimal` (64-bit integers, and 128-bit floating point numbers) are converted to JSON strings to avoid loss
  of precision
- dates are converted to strings in ISO 8601 format
- object IDs are converted to hex-encoded strings

If there is a value in a query response that does not match the type defined in the Hasura schema configuration then the
query will fail with an error.

In some cases it is not possible to configure a specific type for a collection field. For example if a field contains
different types of data in different documents since Hasura does not implement union types. In those cases the
configured type of a field may be `extendedJSON`. This is a fallback that captures any values that can be represented in
BSON. To preserve type information values of this type are converted to JSON according to the canonical variation of the
[MongoDB Extended JSON v2 spec](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/). For example,

- numbers are converted to objects with a type tag and a string value, like `{ "$numberDouble": "3.14" }`
- dates are converted to the form, `{"$date": {"$numberLong": "<milliseconds since Unix Epoch>" } }`
- object IDs are converted to this form, `{ "$oid": "<hex-encoded string>" }`

Queries may include input values in the form of arguments. These are converted from JSON to BSON according to the
inverse of the above. For example,

- if the type of an argument is `double` then a valid input is `3.14`.
- if the type of an argument is `extendedJSON` then either `{ "$numberDouble": "3.14" }` or `3.14` is valid.

In general if an argument value does not match the expected type then the query will fail with an error. But there are a
few cases where we apply implicit conversion where the BSON types have indistinguishable JSON representations. In
particular, it is permissible to provide a GraphQL `Int` value where a `double` is expected, or to provide a GraphQL
`Float` value where an `int` is expected.

## Queries

The Hasura MongoDB data connector supports all query operations; see the
[query documentation](/graphql-api/queries/index.mdx) for details.

### Filtering

The MongoDB data connector supports the introspection and usage of all binary comparison functions and operators
defined for any tracked scalar type, built-in and user-defined alike. Refer to
[filters documentation](/graphql-api/queries/filters/index) for more information.

## Mutations

Mutations are still undergoing active development and are likely to change in the future. Currently, you can write your
own mutations using [Native Mutations](/connectors/mongodb/native-mutations).

## Troubleshooting the MongoDB Connector

### I'd like to tweak how the connector works or does database introspection

Visit the [Configuration page](/connectors/mongodb/config.mdx) for more information.

### unprocessable content: error converting MongoDB response to JSON: expected a value of type Scalar(String), but got null

This happens when there is a discrepancy between types in the database data and the schema that was generated.

Usually this can happen when sampling determined that a field was non-nullable when in fact it is a nullable field.
In this case you manually update the proper collections schema json file in the `schema` directory to be non-nullable.

### I'm having issues getting my Native Query to run
