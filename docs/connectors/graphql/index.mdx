# GraphQL Connector

The Hasura GraphQL Data Connector allows for bringing a GraphQL API into a Hasura DDN supergraph API.

The GraphQL Data Connector replaces the [Remote Schemas](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/remote-schemas/overview/)
functionality from Hasura v2 and can also be used to bring in an existing Hasura v2 GraphQL API into Hasura DDN.

The connector is built using the [Rust Native Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub#rusk-sdk) and
implements the [Native Data Connector Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec).

The connector translates the root-fields of a GraphQL schema to NDC
[functions](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/schema/functions.html) and
[procedures](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/schema/procedures.html). This results in your GraphQL
root fields being exposed as [commands](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/supergraph-modeling/commands) in the supergraph.
This simplifies implementation and acts as a proxy more than a
[model](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/supergraph-modeling/models).

The recent support for field arguments and header forwarding on [Hasura v3
engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/v3) allow the connector to represent the majority of
queries and mutations.
