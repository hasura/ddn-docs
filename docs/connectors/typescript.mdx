# Custom Business Logic using the TypeScript Connector

You can implement custom business logic in your Hasura project using a TypeScript connector such as the
[Node.js Lambda Connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-nodejs-lambda).

## Functions or Procedures

TypeScript functions exported from a file in the [Node.js Lambda Connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-nodejs-lambda)
will then be available from your Hasura DDN GraphQL API.

In Hasura DDN, _**Functions**_ are used for read operations. They will not modify the data in the database and can only
be used to retrieve data.

Conversely, _**Procedures**_ are used for write operations. They can modify the data in the database and can be used to
create, update, or delete data.

## Setting up Business Logic using TypeScript

You can find the information you need to configure, run, test, build, and deploy the Typescript connector on the
[TypeScript mutations](/graphql-api/mutations/typescript.mdx) page.
