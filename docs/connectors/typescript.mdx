# Custom Business Logic using the TypeScript Connector

A connector can be inferred from a TypeScript file. This gives you the ability to write custom business logic in
Typescript and have it run as a connector.

You can find all the information you need to configure, run, test, and deploy the Typescript connector on the
[Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors/typescript-deno).
