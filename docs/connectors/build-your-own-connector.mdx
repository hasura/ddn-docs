# Build Your Own Connector

You can build your own connector using one of our SDKs. Currently, we have the following available:

- [Rust Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub#rust-sdk)
- [TypeScript Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript)

Alternatively, you can implement the NDC spec directly, or use the
[TypeScript connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-typescript-deno) for simple functions and procedures.

## Examples

### CSV Connector - Direct NDC Spec Implementation

The NDC Specification documentation can be found [here](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/overview.html) and a guide,
based on developing a connector for CSVs, can be found [here](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/tutorial/index.html).
You can use this guide as a reference to build your own connector.

:::info Limitations

Complex input types in procedures are not supported yet.

### Sendgrid Connector - Rust SDK

An example of implementing the Sendgrid API can be found [on GitHub here](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/).

The architecture can be summarized as follows:

- The connector is designed to work via the
  [`hasura3 connector` plugin](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/hasura-cli/connector-plugin/) deployment method.
- As with all connector-plugin connectors, the connector is built and run as defined in its
  [Dockerfile](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/blob/main/Dockerfile)
  - The `Dockerfile`:
    - Installs system dependencies
    - Builds the Rust Cargo project
    - Copies the release build
    - Starts the server reading the configuration from `/config.json`
- The connector is implemented using the [Rust Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub#rust-sdk)
  - The [`main` entrypoint](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/blob/main/crates/ndc-sendgrid/src/main.rs) uses the
    SDK's `default_main` method invoked with our `SendGridConnector` implementation of the `Connector` trait.
  - The most important aspects of this implementation are
    - Defining its `SendGridConfiguration` that includes its API Key.
    - Exposing its `/schema`
    - Providing a `/query` to list email templates
    - Providing a `/mutation` to send emails
  - The
    [SendGrid API interactions](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/blob/main/crates/ndc-sendgrid/src/sendgrid_api.rs)
    expose
    - `invoke_list_function_templates`, and
    - `invoke_send_mail`
- With all this in place the connector can be used by referencing
  [the repository](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid) and running the following command:

  ```bash
  hasura3 connector create sendgrid:v1 --github-repo-url https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/tree/main --config-file config.json
  ```

- The running connector can then:
  - Be referenced in Hasura v3 metadata
  - Leveraged by the LSP
  - Targeted by the engine
  - Receive Translated GraphQL Queries

### Sendgrid Connector - Typescript Connector

The [TypeScript Connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-typescript-deno/) provides a simple way to deploy TypeScript
functions as data connectors. **There is no need to implement an API, use an SDK, or write a Dockerfile.** Simply
provide a Typescript function to the Typescript Connector and it will be deployed and executed within the
[Deno](https://deno.com/) runtime.

As an example, we can write a Sendgrid connector consisting of the following two files:

`functions/sendgrid.ts`:

```typescript
import { sendSimpleMail, IResult } from "https://deno.land/x/sendgrid@0.0.3/mod.ts";

export async function send(subject: string, to: string, from: string, plain: string, html: string): Promise<IResult> {
  const API_KEY = Deno.env.get("SENDGRID_API_KEY");

  if (!API_KEY) {
    throw new Error("Error: SENDGRID_API_KEY environment variable must be set.");
  }

  const response = await sendSimpleMail(
    {
      subject,
      to: [{ email: to }],
      from: { email: from },
      content: [
        { type: "text/plain", value: plain },
        { type: "text/html", value: html },
      ],
    },
    {
      apiKey: API_KEY,
    }
  );

  return response;
}
```

`config.json`:

```json
{
  "typescript_source": "/functions/sendgrid.ts"
}
```

The file `config.json` tells the Typescript Connector where to find our Typescript function. The file
`functions/sendgrid.ts` contains the function itself.

To deploy the connector you can use the command:

```bash
hasura3 connector create sendgrid:deno:v1 --github-repo-url https://github.com/hasura/ndc-typescript-deno/tree/main --config-file config.json --volume ./functions:/functions --env SENDGRID_API_KEY='YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY'
```

The example code shown here can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid-deno).
