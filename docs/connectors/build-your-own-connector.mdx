# Build Your Own Connector

You can build your own connector using one of our SDKs. Currently, we have the following available:

- [Rust Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub#rust-sdk)
- [TypeScript Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript)

Alternatively, you can implement the NDC spec directly, or use the
[TypeScript connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-typescript-deno) for simple functions and procedures.

## Create a Connector tutorial

If you are interested in creating a connector, we have a series of video tutorials that walk you through the
process. We have these available in a repo you can [check out here](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-learn/tree/main).

## Examples

### CSV Connector - Direct NDC Spec Implementation

The NDC Specification documentation can be found [here](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/overview.html) and a guide,
based on developing a connector for CSVs, can be found [here](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/tutorial/index.html).
You can use this guide as a reference to build your own connector.

:::info Limitations

Complex input types in procedures are not supported yet.

### Sendgrid Connector - Rust SDK

An example of implementing the Sendgrid API can be found [on GitHub here](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/).
