# Native Queries

## Introduction

Native Queries allow you to run custom SQL queries on your PostgreSQL database. These allow you to run queries that are
not supported by Hasura's GraphQL engine.

## Structure

A Native Query is a single SQL statement that returns results and can take arguments. The SQL structure of a Native
Query is specified in the [Native Operation syntax](/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/syntax.mdx) page.

## Create a Native Query

To create a new Native Query, create a new SQL file inside the connector configuration directory, then use the `ddn` CLI
to add it to the connector configuration. For example:

1. Create a new directory structure under the connector configuration:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p my_subgraph/connector/chinook_pg/native_operations/queries/
   ```

2. Create a new SQL file `my_subgraph/connector/chinook_pg/native_operations/queries/artist_by_name_between.sql` with
   the following content:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "Artist"
   WHERE "Name" LIKE '%' || {{name}} || '%'
     AND "ArtistId" > {{lower_bound}}
     AND "ArtistId" < {{upper_bound}}
   ```

3. Create a new entry in the connector configuration:

   ```sh
   ddn connector plugin --connector my_subgraph/connector/chinook_pg/connector.yaml -- \
     native-operation create --operation-path native_operations/queries/artist_by_name_between.sql --kind query
   ```

4. Add a source entity as described in our
   [add source entities](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/02-create-source-metadata.mdx) guide.

## List Native Operations

To list the existing Native Operations for a specific connector, use the `list` command. For example:

```sh
ddn connector plugin --connector my_subgraph/connector/chinook_pg/connector.yaml -- \
  native-operation list
```

## Delete a Native Query

A Native Query can be deleted with the `delete` command. For example:

```sh
ddn connector plugin --connector my_subgraph/connector/chinook_pg/connector.yaml -- \
  native-operation delete --name artist_by_name_between --kind query
```

### Usage

With the example above, you can then use the query in your GraphQL API like this:

```graphql
query {
  artist_by_name_between(name: "Black", lower_bound: 10, upper_bound: 50) {
    ArtistId
    Name
  }
}
```
