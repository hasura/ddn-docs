# Vector Search

Vector search allows you to run queries on vector types in your PostgreSQL database. This page explains how to configure
vector search in Hasura using Native Queries.

:::info Prerequisites

In order to run a vector search query, you need to have a PostgreSQL database with the
[`pgvector` extension](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) installed. You'll also need data in the database which has
been vectorized using a [model such as `word2vec`](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/word2vec).

:::

## Example

Imagine a `products` table like the one we use in the docs-sample-app with the following columns:

| Column Name       | Type        |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| id                | uuid        |
| name              | text        |
| description       | text        |
| price             | int4        |
| manufacturer_id   | uuid        |
| category_id       | uuid        |
| image             | text        |
| country_of_origin | text        |
| created_at        | timestamptz |
| updated_at        | timestamptz |
| vector            | vector      |

We want to be able to run vector searches on the `vector` column of this table. We can do this by writing a query to
project the vector similarity given a query vector and expose it as a model in Hasura. Then, we can create a
relationship from this projection to the full products table and query it flexibly in the GraphQL API.

### Create a vector search Native Query

1. Create a new SQL file under the connector configuration directory
   `my_subgraph/connector/my_pg/native_operations/queries/products_vector_distance.sql` with the following content:

   ```sql
   SELECT
   id,
   vector <=> {{query_vector}} AS distance
   FROM products
   ```

2. Create an entry for the Native Query in the connector configuration:

   ```sh
   ddn connector plugin --connector my_subgraph/connector/my_pg/connector.yaml -- \
     native-operation create --operation-path native_operations/queries/products_vector_distance.sql --kind query
   ```

### Hasura metadata

First, you would need to track the newly-available collection from the step above as types / models in your project's
metadata ([see instructions here](/docs/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/02-create-source-metadata.mdx)). Then,
you would need to add a relationship from the generated `ProductsVectorDistance` type to the main `Products` model, like
this:

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: product
  source: ProductsVectorDistance
  target:
    model:
      name: Products
      relationshipType: Object
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: id
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: id
```

### Usage

Now you can use the flexibility of Hasura's GraphQL API to search your vectors in many ways.

#### Search products based on vector

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  productsVectorDistance(args: { query_vector: "<input vector>" }, limit: 10, order_by: { distance: Asc }) {
    id
    distance
    product {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

#### Search products based on price and vector

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  productsVectorDistance(
    args: { query_vector: "<input vector>" }
    limit: 10
    order_by: { distance: Asc }
    where: { product: { price: { _gt: 500 } } }
  ) {
    id
    distance
    product {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Permissions

You can also set the appropriate model permissions to restrict which rows can be accessed by an API client. The
permissions predicate for the vectors can also traverse relationships.

For example, if we want to restrict manufacturers to being able to search vectors only for their own products, and
assuming the currently logged in manufacturer's ID is present in the session variable `x-hasura-manufacturer-id`, we
would add the following to the metadata:

```yaml
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: ProductsVectorDistance
  permissions:
    - role: manufacturer
      select:
        filter:
          relationship:
            name: product
            predicate:
              fieldComparison:
                field: manufacturer_id
                operator: _eq
                value:
                  sessionVariable: x-hasura-manufacturer-id
```
