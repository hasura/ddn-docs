# Native Operations

## Introduction

Native Operations allow you to run custom SQL queries on your PostgreSQL database. This allows you to run queries that
are not supported by Hasura DDN's GraphQL engine. This unlocks the full power of your database, allowing you to run
complex queries, mutations, and even vector searches â€” all directly from your Hasura GraphQL API.

## Types of Native Operations

You can check out examples of the different types of Native Operations below:

- [Native Queries](/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/custom-queries.mdx)
- [Native Mutations](/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/custom-mutations.mdx)
- [Vector Search](/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/vector-search.mdx)
