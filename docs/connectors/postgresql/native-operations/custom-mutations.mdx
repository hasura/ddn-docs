# Native Mutations

## Introduction

Native Mutations allow you to run custom SQL queries on your PostgreSQL database that can be exposed via the Hasura
GraphQL engine and modify the database state.

:::danger Permissions not yet supported

Native Mutations do not yet support permissions. This means that any user with access to the GraphQL API can execute
Native Mutations. Ensure that you have appropriate security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access. An update
on this feature will be provided in an upcoming release.

:::

## Structure

A Native Mutation is a single SQL statement that returns results and can take arguments, and might modify the database.
The SQL structure of a Native Mutation is specified in the
[Native Operation syntax](/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/syntax.mdx) page, but require an important tweak:

The SQL should include a `RETURNING` clause, listing the returned columns (use `RETURNING *` to return all columns).

## Create a Native Mutation

To create a new Native Mutation, create a new SQL file inside the connector configuration directory, then use the `ddn`
CLI to add it to the connector configuration. For example:

1. Create a new directory structure under the connector configuration:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p my_subgraph/connector/chinook_pg/native_operations/mutations/
   ```

2. Create a new SQL file `my_subgraph/connector/chinook_pg/native_operations/mutations/insert_artist.sql` with the
   following content:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO public."Artist" VALUES (
     ( SELECT "ArtistId" + 1
       FROM "Artist"
       ORDER BY "ArtistId" DESC
       LIMIT 1
     ),
     {{name}}
   )
   RETURNING *
   ```

3. Create a new entry in the ndc-postgres configuration:

   ```sh
   ddn connector plugin -c my_subgraph/connector/chinook_pg/connector.yaml -- \
     native-operation create --operation-path native_operations/mutations/insert_artist.sql --kind mutation
   ```

4. Add a source entity as described in our
   [add source entities](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/02-create-source-metadata.mdx) guide.

## List Native Operations

To list the existing Native Operations for a specific connector, use the `list` command. For example:

```sh
ddn connector plugin -c my_subgraph/connector/chinook_pg/connector.yaml -- \
  native-operation list
```

## Delete a Native Mutation

A Native Query can be deleted with the `delete` command. For example:

```sh
ddn connector plugin -c my_subgraph/connector/chinook_pg/connector.yaml -- \
  native-operation delete --name insert_artist --kind mutation
```

## Usage

With the example above, you can then run the mutation in your GraphQL API like this:

```graphql
mutation {
  insert_artist(name: "New Artist") {
    ArtistId
    Name
  }
}
```
