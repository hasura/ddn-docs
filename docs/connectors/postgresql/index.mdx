# Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL

## Introduction

The Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL is our flagship connector, with rich support for all kinds of queries. In the
sections below, we'll try to give an overview of the features of the PostgreSQL connector and how to configure it in a
Hasura project.

:::tip Flavors of PostgreSQL

As much as possible we attempt to provide explicit support for database projects that identify as being derived from
PostgreSQL with this connector. This includes various popular hosting options for PostgreSQL proper.

The following variants and hosting offerings enjoy the same level of support as a dedicated installation of the latest
stable PostgreSQL release:

- [AWS Aurora][AWS Aurora], distributed PostgreSQL derivative and service offering
- [Citus][Citus], PostgreSQL extension
- [Cockroach][Cockroach], distributed PostgreSQL-compatible service offering
- [YugabyteDB][YugabyteDB], distributed PostgreSQL derivative and service offering

[Cockroach]: https://cockroachlabs.com
[YugabyteDB]: https://yugabyte.com
