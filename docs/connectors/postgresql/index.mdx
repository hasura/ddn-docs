# Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL

## Introduction

The Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL is our flagship connector, with rich support for all kinds of queries. In the
sections below, we'll cover the supported SQL data types, GraphQL types, and query operations.

:::tip Flavors of PostgreSQL

This connector works with most flavors of PostgreSQL — such as Yugabyte and Aurora — but has not been tested with all.
If you are looking for a connector for a specific flavor of PostgreSQL, you can search the
[Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors) or [build your own](/connectors/build-your-own-connector.mdx).

## Scalar types

SQL data types are mapped to GraphQL types. The current mappings are as follows:

| SQL data type | GraphQL type |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| `bool`        | `Boolean`    |
| `int2`        | `Int`        |
| `int4`        | `Int`        |
| `int8`        | `Int`        |
| `float4`      | `Float`      |
| `float8`      | `Float`      |
| `numeric`     | `Float`      |
| `char`        | `String`     |
| `varchar`     | `String`     |
| `text`        | `String`     |
| `uuid`        | `String`     |
| `date`        | `String`     |
| `time`        | `String`     |
| `timestamp`   | `String`     |
| `timestamptz` | `String`     |
| `timetz`      | `String`     |

Other SQL scalar types are unsupported, but may still work in certain situations.

:::info Data type aliases

Note that many of these SQL data types have aliases in PostgreSQL, which can be found in the [PostgreSQL documentation
on data types][PostgreSQL: data types].

## Nested types

The connector does not currently support nested data structures, such as `array`, `hstore`, `json`, or `jsonb`, though
they may still work in certain situations.

## Queries

The connector supports all query operations; see the [query documentation](/graphql-api/queries/index.mdx) for details.

### Predicates

The `_is_null` operator checks whether a value is `NULL`.

The following binary operators are supported when filtering:

| Name                       | GraphQL operator | PostgreSQL operator | GraphQL types |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| equals                     | `_eq`            | `=`                 | all           |
| not equals                 | `_neq`           | `<>`                | all           |
| less than                  | `_lt`            | `<`                 | all           |
| less than or equal to      | `_lte`           | `<=`                | all           |
| greater than               | `_gt`            | `>`                 | all           |
| greater than or equal to   | `_gte`           | `>=`                | all           |
| like                       | `_like`          | `LIKE`              | `String`      |
| not like                   | `_nlike`         | `NOT LIKE`          | `String`      |
| case-insensitive like      | `_ilike`         | `ILIKE`             | `String`      |
| not case-insensitive like  | `_nilike`        | `NOT ILIKE`         | `String`      |
| similar                    | `_similar`       | `SIMILAR TO`        | `String`      |
| not similar                | `_nsimilar`      | `NOT SIMILAR TO`    | `String`      |
| regex                      | `_regex`         | `~`                 | `String`      |
| not regex                  | `_nregex`        | `!~`                | `String`      |
| case-insensitive regex     | `_iregex`        | `~`                 | `String`      |
| not case-insensitive regex | `_niregex`       | `!~`                | `String`      |

The `_not`, `_and`, and `_or` operators all work as usual.

## Mutations

The connector supports [mutations via Native Queries](/connectors/postgresql/config.mdx#mutations).
