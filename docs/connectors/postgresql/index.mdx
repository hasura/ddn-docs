# Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL

## Introduction

The Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL is our flagship connector, with rich support for all kinds of queries. In the
sections below, we'll try to give an overview of the features of the PostgreSQL connector and how to configure it in a
Hasura project.

:::tip Flavors of PostgreSQL

As much as possible we attempt to provide explicit support for database projects that identify as being derived from
PostgreSQL with this connector. This includes various popular hosting options for PostgreSQL proper.

The following variants and hosting offerings enjoy the same level of support as a dedicated installation of the latest
stable PostgreSQL release:

* [AWS Aurora][AWS Aurora], distributed PostgreSQL derivative and service offering
* [Citus][Citus], PostgreSQL extension
* [Cockroach][Cockroach], distributed PostgreSQL-compatible service offering
* [YugabyteDB][YugabyteDB], distributed PostgreSQL derivative and service offering

:::

The PostgreSQL data connector makes available any database resource that is listed in its configuration. In order to
populate the configuration, the connector supports introspecting the database via the CLI `update` command.

## Queryable collections

The PostgreSQL data connector supports several types of queryable collections:

* Tables
* Views
* Native queries

Tables and views are typically discovered automatically during the introspection process.

Native queries on the other hand are named SQL select statements that you specify in the data connector configuration.
They are similar to a database view, but more expressive as they admit parameters similar to a function and do not
require any DDL permissions on the database. See the configuration reference on [Native Queries](config.mdx#native-queries).

## Scalar types

The PostgreSQL data connector supports any scalar type that PostgreSQL knows how encode and decode as JSON - No scalar
type is handled as a special case.


:::tip Data type names

Many scalar types have aliases in PostgreSQL, which can be found in the [PostgreSQL documentation on data
types][PostgreSQL: data types].
The connector exposes only the canonical name of a scalar type (as per [`pg_catalog.pg_type(typname)`][PostgreSQL:
pg_type]) in its NDC schema. 

In order to use standard GraphQL scalar types rather than custom scalar types in the resulting GraphQL schema, the DDN
configuration enables expressing a mapping between data connector types and GraphQL types.

:::

:::info Limited support

The data connector doesn't currently support [domain][PostgreSQL: CREATE DOMAIN] types, [enum, or range][PostgreSQL:
CREATE TYPE] types, and the introspection process will not include entities these types.

Manually adding entities of a type to the configuration may work to an extent, but there is no guarantee that
e.g. domain constraints will be checked.

:::

## Structural types

The data connector supports postgres array and composite types, and they will appear as such in the schema it exposes.

Collections may have columns that are arrays of any supported type, and columns that are of a composite type, and
arbitrary cominations thereof.

As an example (without regard as to whether this is a good database design or not) the following may be tracked
with full typing fidelity:

```sql
CREATE TYPE address AS (address_lines varchar[], zipcode varchar, country varchar);
CREATE TABLE person(id int primary key, name varchar, address address);
```

Note that the `json` and `jsonb` types are not considered structural types. They are opaque scalar types that do not
admit to any schema.

:::info Limited support

The data connector doesn't currently support introspecting [composite types][PostgreSQL: CREATE TYPE] apart from those
defined implicitly by a table. Custom defined composite types need to be added to the configuration manually to be
usable.

:::

## Queries

The connector supports all query operations; see the [query documentation](/graphql-api/queries/index.mdx) for details.

### Filtering

The connector supports the introspection and usage of all binary comparison functions and operators defined for any
tracked scalar type, built-in and user-defined alike.

However, because PostgreSQL operators don't translate syntactically well to GraphQL, and because not all binary
procedures are necessarily appropriate comparison operators, the introspection process needs some guidance in order to
map names and select which functions to include. See the configuration reference for [Comparison
Operators](config#comparison-operators) for details.

## Mutations

Mutations are still undergoing active development and are likely to change in the future. See
[configureOptions.mutationsVersion](config.mdx#configureoptionsmutationsversion).
