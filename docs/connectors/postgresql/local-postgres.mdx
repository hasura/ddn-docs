# Run Postgres database locally

## Introduction

This guide will take you through setting up a local Postgres database along with [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/), a
free database manager tool, using Docker Compose.

You can use any database management tool you prefer, we're using Adminer here. Some free and paid alternatives are:
[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), [dBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/),
[psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html), [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/),
[DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/), etc.

## Step 1: Create Docker Compose file

The following Docker Compose file contains a Postgres service along with an Adminer service configured to
automatically connect to the Postgres database.

By default,
- Postgres will run on port `5432` and the database connection string will be `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dev`
- Adminer will run on port `8081` and can be accessed on `http://localhost:8081/`

You can change these in the Docker compose file in case you have other services running on those ports already.

Copy the following to a new file, say `compose.postgres-adminer.yaml`:

```yaml title="compose.postgres-adminer.yaml"
version: "3.9"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    #highlight-start
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"  # Run Postgres on port 5432
    #highlight-end
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: dev

  adminer:
    image: adminer:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      ADMINER_DEFAULT_DRIVER: pgsql # server=mysql, pgsql, sqlite, sqlite2, oracle, mssql, mongo, elastic
      ADMINER_DEFAULT_DB: dev
      ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER: postgres
      ADMINER_DEFAULT_USERNAME: user
      ADMINER_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: password
    #highlight-start
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"  # Run Adminer on port 8081
    #highlight-end
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    configs:
      - source: adminer-index.php
        target: /var/www/html/index.php

configs:
  adminer-index.php:
    content: |
      <?php
        if(!count($$_GET)) {
          $$_POST['auth'] = [
            'server' => $$_ENV['ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER'],
            'username' => $$_ENV['ADMINER_DEFAULT_USERNAME'],
            'password' => $$_ENV['ADMINER_DEFAULT_PASSWORD'],
            'driver' => $$_ENV['ADMINER_DEFAULT_DRIVER'],
            'db'    => $$_ENV['ADMINER_DEFAULT_DB'],
          ];
        }
        include './adminer.php';
      ?>
```

## Step 2: Start Postgres database and Adminer

Run the Docker Compose file:

```bash title="In directory with compose file, run:"
docker compose -f compose.postgres-adminer.yaml up
```

## Step 3: Manage your database via Adminer

To access Adminer, head to: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

You should see the Adminer console as follows:

You can now create tables, add data, etc. on the Postgres database and iterate on your database schema.

## Next Steps

### Connect the database to your supergraph

You can connect the Postgres database to your supergraph using the
[Postgres data connector](connectors/postgresql/index.mdx) by following the steps in
[this guide](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx?db=PostgreSQL)
and providing the database connection string as the following:

```bash title="Connection string to connect to local supergraph"
postgresql://user:password@local.hasura.dev:5432/dev
```

As you iterate on your database schema you can update your supergraph metadata using the steps in
[this guide](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/02-create-source-metadata.mdx).

:::warning Connecting to your local database from the cloud

Note that as this is a locally running database you can connect to it directly from the data connector running locally,
however, if you deploy your connector to Hasura DDN, the cloud-hosted version of your data connector won't be able to
find your local database. You'll need to use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to provide a tunnel to access your
database from the cloud. This will expose the port, most likely `5432`, on which the database is running and allow
Hasura DDN to connect to it.

:::

### Connect to the database directly

You can also connect to the database directly using other tools, such as `psql`, using the database connection string:

```bash title="To connect using psql, run:"
psql postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dev
```
