# Native Queries

## Introduction

Native queries allow you to run custom SQL queries on your PostgreSQL database. This allows you to run queries that are
not supported by Hasura's GraphQL engine. This unlocks the full power of your database, allowing you to run complex
queries, mutations, and even vector searches â€” all directly from your Hasura GraphQL API.

Native queries can be defined by adding them to the `metadata.nativeQueries` section of the `configuration.json` for a
particular connector. Each query is specified as SQL. The return structure of the query must be explicitly specified in
the `"columns"` field.

Native queries can take arguments using the `{{argument_name}}` syntax. Arguments must be specified along with their
type. The arguments are not interpolated, but provided to your data source as parameters, and therefore must be specific
values, not arbitrary SQL.

## Types of Native Queries

You can check out examples of the different types of native queries below:

- [Custom Queries](/connectors/postgresql/native-queries/custom-queries.mdx)
- [Custom Mutations](/connectors/postgresql/native-queries/custom-mutations.mdx)
- [Vector Search](/connectors/postgresql/native-queries/vector-search.mdx)
