# Native Queries

## Introduction

Native Queries allow you to run custom SQL queries on your PostgreSQL database. This allows you to run queries that are
not supported by Hasura DDN's GraphQL engine. This unlocks the full power of your database, allowing you to run complex
queries, mutations, and even vector searches â€” all directly from your Hasura GraphQL API.

## Types of Native Queries

You can check out examples of the different types of native queries below:

- [Custom Queries](/connectors/postgresql/native-queries/custom-queries.mdx)
- [Custom Mutations](/connectors/postgresql/native-queries/custom-mutations.mdx)
- [Vector Search](/connectors/postgresql/native-queries/vector-search.mdx)
