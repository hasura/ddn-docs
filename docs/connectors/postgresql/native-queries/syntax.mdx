# Native Query SQL Syntax

There are a few requirements for writing valid Hasura DDN Native Query SQL:

## Arguments are defined in double curly braces

Arguments are specified with double curly braces as variables in your statement, like `{{id}}`, `{{name}}`, etc. These
are placeholders for the actual values.

## Arguments as scalar values only

The arguments are not interpolated, but are translated to parameters of parameterized queries (arguments like `{{id}}`
and `{{name}}` are translated to `$1`, `$2`, etc.) and passed as data, and therefore can only be used in place of scalar
values, not table names, column names, or other arbitrary SQL.

## No quoting of string arguments

Since the arguments are translated to parameters of parameterized queries, they are passed as data and do not need to be
quoted. For example, use `{{name}}` instead of `'{{name}}'`.

## Single statements only

The SQL of a Native Query should be a single SQL statement that returns a result and **should not contain a semicolon**
at the end, as the SQL is used inside another SQL query.

## String value arguments in patterns using concatenation

Since you can't directly interpolate arguments (like variables) into your SQL statements in the same way you might in
other contexts, in order to use a string argument inside a pattern, such as in a `LIKE` predicate, the argument can be
concatenated with the relevant pattern parts.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Artist" WHERE "Name" LIKE '%John%'
```

can be written as

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Artist" WHERE "Name" LIKE '%' || {{name}} || '%'
```

using the `||` concatenation operator to concatenate the parts of the pattern with the argument variable.

## No "hasura\_" prefixed arguments

Argument names that begin with the prefix `hasura_` are reserved for internal use.
