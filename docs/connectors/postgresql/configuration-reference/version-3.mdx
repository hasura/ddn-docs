# Configuration Reference, Version 3

:::warning Deprecated

This configuration version is deprecated and should be
[upgraded to the latest version](./index.mdx#upgrading-the-configuration-format-version).

:::

## Configuration workflows

The data connector provides a plugin to the hasura CLI to assist you in authoring configuration.

We provide the `ndc-postgres-cli`, which is a small executable whose, builds can be accessed
[here](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-postgres/releases/).

:::warning Current status

The intended way to commonly use this plugin is through the main `ddn` CLI.

But at the time of this writing this part of the developer experience is undergoing active development, so the exact
command invocations are likely to be different from what is described here.

Therefore this document will give workflow descriptions using the data connector CLI plugin directly. This is likely to
change in the near future.

:::

### The default configuration

Running `ndc-postgres-cli initialize` in an empty directory will produce a single file, `configuration.json`, reproduced
here in abbreviated form:

```yaml
{
  "version": "3",
  "$schema": "./schema.json",
  "connectionSettings":
    {
      "connectionUri": { "variable": "CONNECTION_URI" },
      "isolationLevel": "ReadCommitted",
      "poolSettings":
        {
          "maxConnections": 50,
          "poolTimeout": 30,
          "idleTimeout": 180,
          "connectionLifetime": 600,
          "checkConnectionAfterIdle": 60,
        },
    },
  "mutationsVersion": null,
  "metadata":
    {
      "tables": {},
      "compositeTypes": {},
      "nativeQueries": {},
      "aggregateFunctions": {},
      "comparisonOperators": {},
      "typeRepresentations": {},
    },
  "introspectionOptions":
    {
      "excludedSchemas":
        ["information_schema", "pg_catalog", "tiger", "crdb_internal", "columnar", "columnar_internal"],
      "unqualifiedSchemasForTables": ["public"],
      "unqualifiedSchemasForTypesAndProcedures": ["public", "pg_catalog", "tiger"],
      "comparisonOperatorMapping":
        [
          { "operatorName": "=", "exposedName": "_eq", "operatorKind": "equal" },
          { "operatorName": "<=", "exposedName": "_lte", "operatorKind": "custom" },

          ...,
        ],
      "introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators": ["box_above", "box_below", ...],
    },
}
```

The various default values of `introspectionOptions` fields are output explicitly. This provides both immediacy, because
you don't have to look up what the default values are, and versioning flexibly, because it allows the defaults to evolve
without requiring a version bump.

### A minimal configuration

The very minimal configuration that is acceptable contains just the `version` and `connectionUri` fields:

```yaml
{ "version": "3", "connectionSettings": { "connectionUri": { "value": "postgres://..." } } }
```

or, to get the connection uri from an environment variable:

```yaml
{ "version": "3", "connectionSettings": { "connectionUri": { "variable": "CONNECTION_URI" } } }
```

Note that the choice of environment variable name `CONNECTION_URI` is only a matter of convention. Any environment
variable can be used.

### Updating with introspection

Whenever the schema of your database changes you will need to update your data connector configuration accordingly to
reflect those changes.

Running `ndc-postgres-cli update` in a configuration directory will do the following:

Connect to the database with the specified `connectionUri`, and then overwrite all data in the `metadata` field (except
for the native queries) based on the contents of the database and the values given in the `introspectionOptions` field.

Fill in default values for any fields absent from the configuration, as described in the
[Versioning Policy](/connectors/postgresql/configuration-reference/index.mdx#versioning-policy) section.

Various fields in the `introspectionOptions` object influence the outcome of the introspection process, See
[Configure options](#manually-editing).

### Manually editing

There are occasions when the automatic introspection falls short of your needs. For instance, it may not detect a
particular entity type, or it may pick names according to conventions you disagree with.

If you find yourself in this situation you may still be able to bring your configuration into an acceptable state by
editing it manually. In this case you'd be well advised to keep your configuration files under version control, as
re-running the `update` command will overwrite your manually-crafted changes.

If there is a pattern to the changes you find yourself applying manually it's possible that your use case could warrant
a new `introspectionOptions` field that could integrate the pattern with the normal introspection process. Feel free to
raise a feature request issue on the [Issue Tracker][NDC Postgres Issue Tracker].

One section of the configuration that will always need manual authorship is the user-defined
[`nativeQueries`](/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/index.mdx).

## `version`

This field indicates the version of the configuration format that the configuration file adheres to. See
[Versioning Policy](/connectors/postgresql/configuration-reference/index.mdx#versioning-policy).

The currently supported version is: `"3"`.

## `connectionSettings`

### `connectionUri`

The `connectionUri` field indicates the uri of the database which the connector will be querying. This can be given
either as a literal value, or sourced from an environment variable (to help with sound credentials storage for
instance).

The PostgreSQL database URL should follow the [PostgreSQL connection URI form][libpq: Connection Strings]

**Examples:**

```yaml
"connectionUri": "postgresql://user:password@host/databasename"
```

```yaml
"connectionUri": { "variable": "CONNECTION_URI" }
```

Note that the choice of environment variable name `CONNECTION_URI` is only a matter of convention. Any environment
variable can be used.

[libpq: Connection Strings]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING

### `poolSettings`

This field indicates how the data connector should manage connection pooling.

The default value is:

```yaml
"poolSettings":
  {
    "maxConnections": 50,          // Maximum number of pool connections
    "poolTimeout": 30,             // Maximum time to acquire a connection from the pool (seconds)
    "checkConnectionAfterIdle": 60 // Time at which an idle connection will be checked as still being alive (seconds / null)
    "idleTimeout": 180,            // Time at which an idle connection will be released from the pool (seconds)
    "connectionLifetime": 600,     // Maximum time for an individual connection (seconds)
  }
```

The `idleTimeout` and `connectionLifetime` options may be set to `null`. This indicates that connections will never be
retired from the pool. The `checkConnectionAfterIdle` option may also be set to `null`. This indicates that the
connection should be checked each time we acquire it from the pool.

Note the distinction between setting the fields to `null` versus omitting them. `null` indicates an indefinite value and
omission indicates the default value.

### `isolationLevel`

This field indicates the isolation level of the transaction in which a query is executed.

It may take on the following values:

- `ReadCommitted` (the default). Prevents reading data from another uncommitted transaction.
- `RepeatableRead`. Reading the same data twice is guaranteed to return the same result.
- `Serializable`. Concurrent transactions behave identically to serializing them one at a time.

## `metadata`

The metadata section collects declarations of all the database entities that are known to the data connector.

### `tables`

The `tables` field collects all the tables and views, and the collection name that will be used for each of them.

Consult the [json schema reference][Configuration JSON Schema] for details.

**Example**

```yaml
"tables":
  {
    "Album":
      {
        // Exposed collection name "schemaName": "public",
        "tableName": "Album",
        // The actual name of the table in the database "columns":
          {
            "AlbumId":
              {
                // The exposed field name "name": "AlbumId",
                // The actual name of the column in the table "type": { "scalarType": "int4" },
                "nullable": "nonNullable",
                "description": "The identifier of an album",
              },
            "ArtistId":
              {
                "name": "ArtistId",
                "type": { "scalarType": "int4" },
                "nullable": "nonNullable",
                "description": "The id of the artist that authored the album",
              },
            "Title":
              {
                "name": "Title",
                "type": { "scalarType": "varchar" },
                "nullable": "nonNullable",
                "description": "The title of an album",
              },
          },
        "uniquenessConstraints": { "PK_Album": ["AlbumId"] },
        "foreignRelations":
          {
            "FK_AlbumArtistId":
              {
                "foreignSchema": "public",
                "foreignTable": "Artist",
                "columnMapping": { "ArtistId": // Column of this table "ArtistId" // Column of the referenced table },
              },
          },
        "description": "The record of all albums",
      },
  }
```

#### The types of a column

Valid column types include all of scalar types, (single-dimension) array types, and composite types.

**Examples**

```yaml
"type": { "scalarType": "varchar" }
```

```yaml
"type": { "arrayType": { "scalarType": "varchar" } }
```

```yaml
"type": {
  "compositeType": "person_address"
},
```

```yaml
"type": { "arrayType": { "compositeType": "person_address" } }
```

:::info Global scope

Note that the support for types is not yet aware of schema namespacing. User-defined types should be defined in the
`search_path` of the database user used by the data connector (e.g., the `public` schema).

:::

### `nativeQueries`

The `nativeQueries` field collects user-specified SQL queries that that may become either queryable collections or
mutations in the generated connector schema.

Each query is specified as SQL, and the types of any query arguments and result columns must be specified explicitly.

**Example**

```json
"nativeQueries": {
  "artist_below_id": {
    "sql": {
      "inline": "SELECT * FROM public.\"Artist\" WHERE \"ArtistId\" < {{id}}"
    },
    "columns": {
      "ArtistId": {
        "name": "ArtistId",
        "type": {
          "scalarType": "int4"
        }
      },
      "Name": {
        "name": "Name",
        "type": {
          "scalarType": "varchar"
        }
      }
    },
    "arguments": {
      "id": {
        "name": "id",
        "type": {
          "scalarType": "int4"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the arguments are provided as query parameters - they are not textually interpolated into the query. As such,
a native query argument are value expressions and cannot be used in the place of e.g. a table name.

See also the main [Native Queries](/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/) documentation.

### `compositeTypes`

The `compositeTypes` field collects information on all explicitly defined composite types (i.e., those that do not arise
implicitly from a table).

:::warning Not introspectable

Note that the introspection tooling is not yet capable of discovering user-defined composite types. For the time being
you will need to author the `compositeTypes` section manually if your project relies on them.

:::

**Example**

Assuming your database has the following types defined:

```sql
CREATE TYPE person_name AS
  (
    first_name text,
    last_name text
  );

CREATE TYPE person_address AS
  (
    address_line_1 text,
    address_line_2 text
  );

CREATE TYPE person AS
  (
    name person_name,
    address person_address
  );
```

Then you may make these types available with the following configuration counterpart:

```yaml
"compositeTypes":
  {
    "person":
      {
        "name": "person",
        "fields":
          {
            "address": { "name": "address", "type": { "compositeType": "person_address" }, "description": null },
            "name": { "name": "name", "type": { "compositeType": "person_name" }, "description": null },
          },
        "description": null,
      },
    "person_address":
      {
        "name": "person_address",
        "fields":
          {
            "address_line_1": { "name": "address_line_1", "type": { "scalarType": "text" }, "description": null },
            "address_line_2": { "name": "address_line_2", "type": { "scalarType": "text" }, "description": null },
          },
        "description": null,
      },
    "person_name":
      {
        "name": "person_name",
        "fields":
          {
            "first_name": { "name": "first_name", "type": { "scalarType": "text" }, "description": null },
            "last_name": { "name": "last_name", "type": { "scalarType": "text" }, "description": null },
          },
        "description": null,
      },
  }
```

### `aggregateFunctions`

The `metadata.aggregateFunctions` field captures the aggregation functions that are defined for the various **scalar
types** that appear in a project.

The introspection process is capable of discovering all compatible aggregation functions.

The only aggregation functions supported are those that take a single argument (which include most of them). The
configuration groups them by the type of their argument.

**Example**

```yaml
"aggregateFunctions": {
  "bool": { // The argument type
    "bool_and": {
      "returnType": "bool" // The result type
    },
    "bool_or": {
      "returnType": "bool"
    },
    "every": {
      "returnType": "bool"
    }
  }
}
```

:::info Global scope

Note that the support for aggregation function is not yet aware of schema namespacing. User-defined aggrate functions
should be defined in the `search_path` of the database user used by the data connector (e.g., the `public` schema).

:::

### `comparisonOperators`

The `metadata.comparisonOperators` field defines the comparison operators that may be used for the various **scalar
types** that appear in a project.

In the configuration, the comparison operators are grouped by the type of their first argument.

The introspection process is capable of discovering most compatible comparison operators, including those accessible
through implicit casts.

Many comparison operators in PostgreSQL are syntactically applied as binary infix operators and denoted by
non-alphabetical symbols. Therefore we map the names of infix operators. This process is controlled by the
`introspectionOptions.comparisonOperatorMapping` field.

Regular functions (i.e. non-infix) are also usable as comparison operators. Prefix functions too are discoverable by the
introspection process. However, there is a large body of pre-existing functions that appear to be comparison functions
according to their type (i.e., they take two arguments and return a bool) yet can't be meaningfully said to be
performing a comparison operation (such as
[`pg_has_role`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-info.html#FUNCTIONS-INFO-ACCESS-TABLE)). Therefore,
only the names mentioned in
[`introspectionOptions.introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators`](#introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators) are
considered by the introspection process.

**Example**

```yaml
"comparisonOperators":
  {
    "char":
      {
        // Type of the first argument "_eq":
          {
            // Exposed mapped name of the operator "operatorName": "=",
            // Name of the operator in the database "operatorKind": "equal",
            // The canonical equality operator (for relationships) "argumentType": "char",
            "isInfix":
              true // Indication of whether the operator is syntactically a binary // infix operator or a binary
              prefix-function,
          },
        "_gt":
          {
            "operatorName": ">",
            "operatorKind": "custom",
            // A non-equality operator "argumentType": "char",
            "isInfix": true,
          },
      },
  }
```

:::info Global scope

Note that the support for comparison operators is not yet aware of schema namespacing. User-defined comparison operators
should be defined in the `search_path` of the database user used by the data connector (e.g., the `public` schema).

:::

### `typeRepresentations`

The `metadata.typeRepresentations` field defines the type representations of the various **scalar types** that appear in
a project. If a type does not have a defined type representation, the default type representation is opaque json.

The type representation of a scalar type indicates what values are considered acceptable in requests, and what values
are expected to be returned in the response.

#### `int8` and `numeric` types

The default type representations of `int8` and `numeric` types are `int64AsString` and `bigDecimalAsString`
respectively. These indicate that values accepted in requests and returned in response will have a string value json
representation, to improve compatibility with common JavaScript clients.

It is possible to configure this option to represent these types as numbers instead. To do so, configure the type
representation of the `int8` type to `int64`, and/or configure the type representation of the `numeric` type to
`bigDecimal` as follows:

```diff
  { ...
    "metadata": {
      ...
      "typeRepresentations": {
        "Phone": "string",
        "CardSuit": {
          "enum": ["hearts", "clubs", "diamonds", "spades"]
        },
        ...
-       "int8": "int64AsString",
+       "int8": "int64",
-       "numeric": "bigDecimalAsString",
+       "numeric": "bigDecimal",
        ...
      }
      ...
    }
  }
```

## `introspectionOptions`

This field collects various options that may be used to drive the configuration and introspection process.

### `excludedSchemas`

The `introspectionOptions.excludedSchemas` field is a list of schema names that the introspection process will ignore.
The default value includes schemas used for internal database bookkeeping and reflection, such as `information_schema`,
for PostgreSQL and common extensions.

**Example (default)**

```yaml
"excludedSchemas": [
    "information_schema", # PostgreSQL
    "pg_catalog", # PostgreSQL
    "tiger", # PostGIS extension
    "crdb_internal", # CockroachDB
    "columnar", # Citus
    "columnar_internal", # Citus
  ]
```

### `unqualifiedSchemasForTables`

The `introspectionOptions.unqualifiedSchemasForTables` field identifies schemas for which the introspection process will
generate table metadata entries that are not prefixed by the schema name.

Tables defined in schemas in this list will have metadata entries that of the form `<table_name>`. Those defined in
schemas not in this list will have metadata entries that of the form `<schema_name>_<table_name>`.

**Example (default)**

```yaml
"unqualifiedSchemasForTables": [
  "public"
],
```

### `unqualifiedSchemasForTypesAndProcedures`

The `introspectionOptions.unqualifiedSchemasForTypesAndProcedures` field identifies schemas for which the introspection
process will generate type and comparison operator metadata entries that are not prefixed by the schema name, similar to
the same for tables.

:::info Global scope

Comparison operators and types only support unqualified access i.e. global scoping currently. Consequentially, types and
operators defined in any schema not in this list will not be discoverable.

:::

**Example (default)**

```yaml
"unqualifiedSchemasForTypesAndProcedures": [
  "public",
  "pg_catalog",
  "tiger"
],
```

### `comparisonOperatorMapping`

The `introspectionOptions.comparisonOperatorMapping` field describes the names that will be used to represent infix
comparison operators such as `=`, `!=`, `LIKE`, `<`, etc.

In order for the introspection process to discover a given operator it must have an entry in this list.

**Example (default, truncated)**

```yaml
"comparisonOperatorMapping":
  [
    { "operatorName": "=", "exposedName": "_eq", "operatorKind": "equal" },
    { "operatorName": "<=", "exposedName": "_lte", "operatorKind": "custom" },
    ...,
  ]
```

### `introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators` {#introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators}

The `introspectionOptions.introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators` gives the list of prefix-functions that are
candidates for comparison operators.

Because of the wide variety of predefined functions in existence this is an inclusion list rather than an exclusion
list. Functions not appearing in this list will not be discoverable by the introspection process.

**Example (default, truncated)**

```yaml
"introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators": ["box_above", "box_below", "box_contain", ...]
```

## `mutationsVersion`

:::warning Experimental feature under ongoing development

Developing support for mutations of tables is an ongoing effort that has still not settled on a concrete form. The
`mutationsVersion` field is essentially a feature flag toggle that will let you opt-in to trying this feature as it
evolves.

Beware that the set of supported mutations versions is expected to have a rapid turnover, and there is no guarantee that
two successive configuration versions will have any overlap in the mutations versions they support.

:::

The `mutationsVersion` field indicates the flavor of table mutations to expose in the schema of the data connector. By
default this field is omitted, resulting in no mutations being generated.

Introduction and removal of supported mutations versions will only happen in the context of a version bump of the main
configuration.

The currently supported value is `"v1"`.

### `mutationsVersion: "v1"`

A table `my_table` gets a `v1_insert_my_table` mutation in the connector schema which takes a single argument `_object`
of object type equivalent to the type of the table. It is a runtime error to insert into columns that are generated. The
mutation result type is that of the table, allowing selection of fields from the row that was inserted.

A table `my_table` with a single-column primary key `my_id_column` gets a `v1_delete_my_table_by_my_id_column` mutation
with a single argument `my_id_column` of type equal to that of the column. The mutation result type is that of the
table, allowing selection of fields from the row that was deleted.

This version of mutations does not support filter-based permissions.
