# Configuration Reference

:::warning Subject to change

During this active development phase, the configuration structure is subject to change.

:::

The format of the configuration data varies between versions. When a connector subgraph is added to a project, a
`schema.json` file is created in the configuration directory which describes the format of the `configuration.json`
file.

## Introduction

The configuration is a metadata object that lists all the database entities — such as tables — that the data connector
has to know about in order to serve queries. It never changes during the lifetime of the data connector service
instance. When your database schema changes you will have to update the configuration accordingly, see
[updating with introspection](#updating-with-introspection).

Below you will find information about how to work effectively with the configuration authoring tools provided by Hasura,
along with the data connector and descriptions of the meanings of each configuration field.

## Versioning policy

The PostgreSQL data connector and its configuration format are versioned independently.

**The data connector will always support at least the latest two configuration versions**, and tooling is provided to
ease the upgrade of configurations. A Hasura DDN project will always use the `head` version of the PostgreSQL data
connector. We recommend doing the same for data connector instances used for local development as well.

During its lifetime, the `head` version of the configuration format may receive backwards-compatible extensions. The
reference documentation of the configuration version will always list the version of the connector which introduced the
configuration extension. The configuration version number is only bumped when it changes in a way that is not backwards
compatible.

Certain fields have default values. The defaults are allowed to evolve over time without requiring a version bump.
Whenever you initialize a new project or update an existing one, all unspecified fields will have their defaults output,
ensuring that only intentional updates to default fields will ever affect the observable behavior of a project, save for
enhancements to performance and security.

The currently supported versions are:

- [`"version": "5"`](version-5) (current).
- [`"version": "4"`](version-4) (deprecated).
- [`"version": "3"`](version-3) (deprecated).

## Configuration workflows

The data connector provides a plugin to the hasura CLI to assist you in authoring configuration.

We provide the `ndc-postgres-cli`, which is a small executable, whose builds can be accessed
[here](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-postgres/releases/).

:::warning Current status

The intended way to commonly use this plugin is through the main `ddn` CLI.

Some of the commands, such as `initialize` and `update`, do not need to be invoked directly as part of the `ddn` CLI workflow.

The commands can be invoked by changing the directory into the connector directory (e.g. `cd my_subgraph/connector/my_pg/`)
and invoking the command using the following syntax:

```sh
ddn connector plugin --connector connector.yaml -- --help
```

:::

### The initial configuration

Running `initialize` in an empty directory will produce a single file, `configuration.json`, containing
a minimal configuration which expects to be given a connection string via the environment variable `CONNECTION_URI`.

This is the same configuration you would get if you were to add a new PostgreSQL data connector to a project with the
`ddn` cli.

### Updating with introspection

Whenever the schema of your database changes you will need to update your data connector configuration accordingly to
reflect those changes.

Running `update` in a configuration directory will do the following:

- Connect to the database with the specified `connectionUri`, and then overwrite all data in the `metadata` field
  (except for the native operations) based on the contents of the database and the values given in the
  `introspectionOptions` field.

- Fill in default values for any fields absent from the configuration, as described in the
  [Versioning Policy](#versioning-policy) section.

Various fields in the `introspectionOptions` object influence the outcome of the introspection process, See
[Configure options](#manually-editing).

### Upgrading the configuration format version

The `ndc-postgres-cli` plugin can assist in upgrading any supported version of a connector configuration to the latest
one.

`upgrade --from-dir <existing configuration dir> --to-dir <new directory>` will produce an upgraded
version of the configuration in `<existing configuration dir>` and place it in `<new directory>`.

For example:

```sh
cd <connector-path> # E.g. my_subgraph/connector/my_pg/
ddn connector plugin --connector connector.yaml -- upgrade --dir-from . --dir-to .
```

Sometimes a configuration format upgrade will need some manual editing of the result, if the new version requires
information that cannot be derived from the previous version. This can vary from case to case, but the upgrade command
will output instructions if there are known manual changes required.

### Manually editing

There are occasions when the automatic introspection falls short of your needs. For instance, it may not detect a
particular entity type, or it may pick names according to conventions with which you disagree.

If you find yourself in this situation you may still be able to bring your configuration into an acceptable state by
editing it manually. In this case you'd be well advised to keep your configuration files under version control, as
re-running the `update` command will overwrite your manually-crafted changes.

If there is a pattern to the changes you find yourself applying manually it's possible that your use case could warrant
a new `introspectionOptions` field that could integrate the pattern with the normal introspection process. Feel free to
raise a feature request issue on the [Issue Tracker][Graphql-Engine Issue Tracker].

One section of the configuration that will always need manual authorship is the user-defined
[`nativeQueries`](/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/index.mdx).
