      <p>Data Connectors are the way to connect your Hasura GraphQL Engine to external data sources.</p>
      <p>
        You can use them to query and join data across multiple data sources. Built using the{" "}
        <a href={"https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/"}>Native Data Connector Specification</a>, you can use those which
        are available out of the box, or build your own.
