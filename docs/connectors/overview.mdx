# Data Connectors

## Introduction

Data Connectors are the way to connect your Hasura GraphQL Engine to external data sources.

You can use them to query and join data across multiple data sources. Built using the
[Native Data Connector Specification](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/), you can use those which are available out of
the box, or build your own.
