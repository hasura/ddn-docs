# Hasura Native Data Connectors Overview

<div className="overview-header">
  <div className="overview-text">
    <p>
      Native Data Connectors are a way to connect your Hasura GraphQL Engine to external data sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use them to query and join data across multiple data sources. Built using 
      the Native Data Connector Specification, you can use the ones that are available out of the box, or build your own.

## What is a data connector?

A data connector is a HTTP service that exposes a set of APIs that Hasura uses to communicate with the data
source. The data connector is responsible for interpreting work to be done on behalf of the Hasura Engine, using the
native query language of the data source.

Data connectors, which are built using the [NDC Specification](http://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/) and closely integrated
with [Open DDS](https://github.com/hasura/open-data-domain-specification), enable anyone to create rich, highly-native
data sources.

The NDC Specification defines a set of APIs that a data connector must implement. These APIs, which accept and return
JSON, are used by Hasura to communicate with the data connector. The NDC Specification also defines a set of metadata
that the data connector must provide to Hasura. This metadata is used by Hasura to introspect the data connector,
generate the GraphQL schema, and execute operations against the data source.


## Types of Data Connector

There are two main types of connector available for use in Hasura V3 projects. Integrated and HTTP connectors. 

### Integrated Connectors

Integrated connectors are configured and deployed via your project metadata only and do not require any additional processes.

An example of an integrated connector is the [Postgres Connector](https://hasura.io/connectors/postgres).

### HTTP Connectors

HTTP connectors are configured and deployed independently of your project metadata and only the URL of the deployed connector is required in your metadata.

While Hasura does not prescribe any process for deploying a HTTP connector it does provide a the `connector` CLI plugin for easily deploying connectors that use our SDKs.

An example of a HTTP connector is the [SendGrid Connector](https://hasura.io/connectors/sendgrid).


## The `connector` CLI Plugin

Open-Source repositories that are set up according to the connector convention can be used via the [Connector CLI plugin](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/hasura-cli/connector-plugin/).

See the [SendGrid Connector's repository](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/tree/main#sendgrid-connector) for an example.

Once you have the Hasura V3 CLI you can install the Connector Plugin as follows:

```
hasura3 plugin install connector
```

Once the plugin is installed use the `--help` option for an overview:

```
> hasura3 connector --help
This Hasura CLI plugin enables deployment and management of custom Hasura data connector agent to Hasura cloud.

Usage:
  connector [command]

Available Commands:
  completion             Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  create                 Create a new Hasura Cloud connector using CLI
  delete                 Delete a Hasura Cloud connector.
  generate-configuration Generate Hasura Connector configuration for the connector given in the flag --github-repo-url
  help                   Help about any command
  list                   List all Hasura Cloud data connectors owned by the user.
  logs                   Tails logs of a deployed custom Hasura data connector.
  status                 Prints the current status of the custom Hasura data connector deployment.
  version                get version information of connector CLI

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for connector
```

All sub-commands can also use the `--help` option:

```
> hasura3 connector create --help
This command triggers deployment of a custom Hasura data connector agent to Hasura Cloud. The source of the connector is fetched from the GitHub repository provided to the flag --github-repo-url. Please make note of these things: 
  - This repository must be publicly accessible. 
  - This repository should follow the GDC spec: https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/dc-agents/DOCUMENTATION.md. 
  - The repository should have a Dockerfile at the root directory. This will be used to build the image.

Usage:
  connector create [connector-name] [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --config-file string       path to the configuration file
  -e, --env stringArray          Set environment variables
      --github-repo-url string   url of the github repo which contains connector source code
  -h, --help                     help for create
  -v, --volume string            mount a folder in the container. Use docker syntax of <host-dir-path>:<container-target-path>
```

**Note:**  you can set the `SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET` environment variable to only allow use from authorised Hasura projects.

Set the environment variable on creation:

```
hasura3 connector create my-connector:v1 \
  --github-repo-url https://github.com/hasura/cool-connector/tree/v0.7 \
  --config-file conf.json \
  --env SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET='MY-SECRET-TOKEN-XXX123'
```

Configure your Hasura project metadata with a matching bearer token:

```yaml
kind: DataSource
name: sendgrid
dataConnectorUrl:
  url: 'https://my-connector-9XXX7-hyc5v23h6a-ue.a.run.app'
auth:
  type: Bearer
  token: "SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN_XXX123"
```

Or via the Hasura secrets functionality:

```yaml
kind: DataSource
name: sendgrid
dataConnectorUrl:
  url: 'https://my-connector-9XXX7-hyc5v23h6a-ue.a.run.app'
auth:
  type: Bearer
  token:
    valueFromSecret: CONNECTOR_TOKEN
```
