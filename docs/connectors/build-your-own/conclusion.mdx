Well done for finishing the tutorial! We hope you enjoyed it and learned about the basics of building a simple data
connector for Hasura DDN.

Obviously, there is a lot more to building a data connector than what we covered in this tutorial. We encourage you to
explore the [Hasura DDN connector spec](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/) to learn more about the
capabilities of the Hasura DDN connector API.

And remember to check out the [Hasura DDN connectors hub](https://hasura.io/connectors#connectors-list) for a growing
list of other connectors built by the both Hasura and the community.

There will be more courses coming soon, so stay tuned!
