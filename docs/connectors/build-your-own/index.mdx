# Build Your Own Connector

You can build your own connector using one of our SDKs. Currently, we have the following available:

- [Rust Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-rs)
- [TypeScript Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript)

Alternatively, you can implement the [NDC (Native Data Connector) spec](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/overview.html)
directly.

## Create a connector in TypeScript tutorial

If you are interested in creating a connector,
[we have a tutorial](/connectors/build-your-own/00-get-started/index.mdx).
which will walk you through the process in TypeScript.

## Connector examples

### CSV Connector - direct NDC spec implementation

The NDC Specification documentation can be found [here](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/overview.html) and a guide,
based on developing a connector for CSVs, can be found [here](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/tutorial/index.html).
You can use this guide as a reference to build your own connector.

:::info Limitations

Complex input types in procedures are not supported yet.

### Sendgrid Connector - Rust SDK

An example of implementing the Sendgrid API can be found [on GitHub here](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/).
