This section focuses on implementing custom binary operators and aggregate functions for the SQLite connector.

We'll start by adding types for each column in the configuration file. Then, we update the schema response to include
these new types and their associated functions.

We add a `LIKE` binary operator for `string` columns and `csv` and `total` aggregate functions for `string` and
`numeric` columns respectively. The `fetch_aggregates` function is updated to handle these new aggregates.

We implement the `LIKE` comparison operator in the `visit_expression` function. Finally, we add custom tests using
`ndc-test` to ensure our new features work correctly.

Let's get started...
