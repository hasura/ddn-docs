In this section, we implement relationships to link database tables, transforming our database into a subgraph within
Hasura's supergraph.

We start by adding a `foreignKeys` property to the `TableConfiguration` type and updating our `configuration.json`. Then, we modify the `get_schema` function to include these relationships.

Next, we refactor the `fetch_rows` function to generate SQL without executing it, enabling the `explain` endpoint. We update the capabilities endpoint and handle relationship fields by generating SQL subqueries with unique table names to avoid collisions.

The `fetch_relationship` function generates SQL for relationship fields, aggregating related rows into JSON arrays using SQLite functions. We also implement postprocessing to correctly format the returned JSON data.

Lastly, we enable `exists` expressions to support complex query scenarios. This tutorial equips our connector with basic relationship query support, setting the stage for advanced features.

Let's get started...
