So we have one more function to define, which is the `query` function, but before we do, let's talk about tests. The
[NDC specification repository](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/) provides a
[test runner executable](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/tree/main/ndc-test) called `ndc-test`, which can be used to
implement a test suite for a connector.

We can also use `ndc-test` to run some automatic tests and validate the work we've done so far.

Back in your `ndc-typescript-learn-course` directory that we cloned during setup, you have a `configuration.json` file
which you can use to run the connector against your sample database.

Now, let's run the tests. (You will need to have the
[ndc test runner](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec/tree/main/ndc-test) installed on your machine.)

```shell
ndc-test test --endpoint http://localhost:8080
```

OR

```shell
cargo run --bin ndc-test -- test --endpoint http://localhost:8080
```

Some tests fail, but we expected them to fail, but we can already see that our schema response is good.

```text
cargo run --bin ndc-test -- test --endpoint http://localhost:8080

Failed with 2 test failures:

[1] Select top N
  in Query
  in albums
  in Simple queries
  in Select top N
Details: error communicating with the connector: error in response: status code 500 Internal Server Error

[2] Select top N
  in Query
  in artists
  in Simple queries
  in Select top N
Details: error communicating with the connector: error in response: status code 500 Internal Server Error
```

In the next section, we'll start to implement the query function, and see some of these tests pass.
