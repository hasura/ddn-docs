Clone the [repo](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-typescript-learn-course) for this project to get started.

```shell
# If using GitHub with SSH
git clone git@github.com:hasura/ndc-typescript-learn-course.git
# OR if using GitHub with HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/hasura/ndc-typescript-learn-course.git
```

You'll see in the main branch two files: `finishedIndex.ts` and `index.ts`. The `finishedIndex.ts` file contains the
completed implementation of the connector as reference, while the `index.ts` file is empty allowing you to follow along.

Then install the dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```

You can build and run the connector, when you need to, with:
```shell
npm run build && node dist/index.js serve --configuration .
```

However, you can run nodemon to watch for changes and rebuild automatically:

```shell
npm run dev
```

[//]: # (TODO: Cannot find more information about the configuration file creation and usage.)

_Note: the configuration.json file is a pre-configured file which gives the connector information about the data 
source._
