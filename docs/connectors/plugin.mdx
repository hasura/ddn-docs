Create a connector:

```
hasura3 connector create my-connector:v1 \
  --github-repo-url https://github.com/hasura/cool-connector/tree/v0.7 \
  --config-file conf.json
```

Delete a connector:

```
hasura3 connector delete my-connector:v1
```

## Advanced Options

### `--env`

To set environment variables when creating a connector you can use the `--env` flag:

```
hasura3 connector create my-connector:v1 \
  --github-repo-url https://github.com/hasura/cool-connector/tree/v0.7 \
  --config-file conf.json \
  --env LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```


### `--volume`

To mount a volume for access by the connector you can use the [docker `--volume` syntax](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#choose-the--v-or---mount-flag).

This will provide the specified file or directory to the build process:

```
hasura3 connector create my-connector:v1 \
  --github-repo-url https://github.com/hasura/cool-connector/tree/v0.7 \
  --config-file conf.json \
  --volume ./my_data:/data
```

WARNING: Connector authors must have a `COPY` command in their `Dockerfile` corresponding to the expected volume mount location.

### `SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET` Environment Variable

If you wish your connector to only be accessed by Hasura you should set the `SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET` environment variable to a secure token and then configure your project metadata with the same token (ideally via the secrets function).

For example:

```
# Generate a secret token

> openssl rand  -base64 40
fErSXC6HDplAZtqxbHJVUmGqGG8AmtJleBquxeNhDsS0CCeXwTYJbg==

# Deploy Connector using token

> hasura3 connector create my-connector:v1 \
  --github-repo-url https://github.com/hasura/cool-connector/tree/v0.7 \
  --config-file conf.json \
  --env SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET=fErSXC6HDplAZtqxbHJVUmGqGG8AmtJleBquxeNhDsS0CCeXwTYJbg==

> hasura3 connector list
my-cool-connector:v1 https://connector-9XXX7-hyc5v23h6a-ue.a.run.app active

# Include in project metadata

> code metadata.hml
> head metadata.hml
kind: DataSource
name: sendgrid
dataConnectorUrl:
  url: 'https://connector-9XXX7-hyc5v23h6a-ue.a.run.app'
auth:
  type: Bearer
  token: "fErSXC6HDplAZtqxbHJVUmGqGG8AmtJleBquxeNhDsS0CCeXwTYJbg=="
```

See the [CLI cloud secret documentation](/ci-cd/cli/commands/cloud-secret.mdx)
for information on how to securly configure secrets such as this token in your projects.
