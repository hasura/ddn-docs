# Region Routing

## Introduction

With region routing, you can force the deployment of your data connector to a region you specify.

## Configuration

You can modify the `Connector` object as per the highlighted values in the example below to enable
fetching data from a specific region.

```yaml title="For example, in my_subgraph/connector/my_connector/connector.yaml:"
kind: Connector
version: v2
definition:
  name: my_connector
  subgraph: my_subgraph
  source: hasura/connector_name:<version>
  context: .
  #highlight-start
  regionConfiguration:
  - region: <region from the list below>
    mode: ReadWrite
    envMapping:
        <CONNECTOR_ENV_VAR>:
            fromEnv: <CONNECTOR_ENV_VAR>
  #highlight-end
```

## Multi-Region Routing

With multi-region routing, you can easily ensure that data is fetched from the data source closest to the user, thus
minimizing latency for the request, improving the performance of your application, and providing a better user
experience.

:::note Currently only supported for PostgreSQL

Multi-region routing is currently supported only for PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL-compatible
[data sources](https://hasura.io/connectors#connectors-list).

:::

To use multi-region routing in Hasura DDN, you only need a supported data source deployed in (or near) more than one of
the supported regions.

```yaml title="For example, in my_subgraph/connector/my_connector/connector.yaml:"
kind: Connector
version: v2
definition:
  name: my_connector
  subgraph: my_subgraph
  source: hasura/connector_name:<version>
  context: .
  #highlight-start
  regionConfiguration:
    - region: <region1: region from the list below>
      mode: ReadWrite
      envMapping:
          <CONNECTOR_ENV_VAR>:
              fromEnv: <CONNECTOR_ENV_VAR_REGION_1> # e.g. DB read write replica URL
    - region: <region2: region from the list below>
      mode: ReadOnly
      envMapping:
          <CONNECTOR_ENV_VAR>:
              fromEnv: <CONNECTOR_ENV_VAR_REGION_2> # e.g. DB read only replica URL in region2
    - region: <region3: region from the list below>
      mode: ReadOnly
      envMapping:
          <CONNECTOR_ENV_VAR>:
              fromEnv: <CONNECTOR_ENV_VAR_REGION_3> # e.g. DB read only replica URL in region3
  #highlight-end
```

## Supported regions

Currently, Hasura DDN supports the following regions in GCP for multi-region routing:

- `gcp-asia-south1`
- `gcp-asia-southeast1`
- `gcp-australia-southeast1`
- `gcp-europe-west1`
- `gcp-southamerica-east1`
- `gcp-us-east4`
- `gcp-us-west2`
