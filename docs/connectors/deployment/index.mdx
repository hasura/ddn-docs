# Deploy a Data Connector

## Integrated connectors

[Integrated connectors](/connectors/introduction.mdx#integrated-connectors) do not need to be deployed, and are
available for immediate use in any project. You can see a full list of integrated connectors on the
[Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors).

## HTTP connectors

### Deploy an HTTP connector via a cloud provider

[HTTP connectors](/connectors/introduction.mdx#http-connectors) can easily be deployed to a variety of cloud providers.
Simply follow the deployment instructions of your chosen provider.

### Deploy an HTTP connector via Hasura using the CLI

You can also deploy them to Hasura using our `connector` CLI plugin. You can see a full list of HTTP connectors on the
[Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors).

Open source repositories that are set up according to the connector convention can be used via the `connector` CLI
plugin.

:::info Curious about an example?

See the [SendGrid connector's repository](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/tree/main#sendgrid-connector) to see
how the connector is set up.

:::

Once you have the Hasura v3 CLI you can install the plugin as follows:

```bash
hasura3 plugin install connector
```

:::info Limit access to your connector

You can set the `SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET` environment variable to only allow requests from authorized clients. Set the
token while deploying the connector and then create a secret on Hasura Cloud with the same value:

```bash
hasura3 secret set -k SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET -v <secret-value>
```

:::

Deploy the connector to Hasura Cloud:

```
hasura3 connector create my-connector:v1 \
  --github-repo-url https://github.com/hasura/cool-connector/tree/v0.7 \
  --config-file conf.json \
  --env SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET='MY-SECRET-TOKEN-XXX123'
```

### Add connecotr to Metadata

Get the URL for the deployed connector and add a `kind: DataConnector` object to your metadata:

```yaml
kind: DataConnector
version: v2
definition:
  name: my_connector
  url:
    singleUrl:
      value: https://my-connector-9XXX7-hyc5v23h6a-ue.a.run.app
  headers:
    Authorization:
      stringValueFromSecret: SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET
```

Build the new metadata:

```bash
hasura3 build create -d "add new connector"
```
