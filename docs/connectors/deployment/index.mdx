# Deploy a Data Connector

## Integrated connectors

[Integrated connectors](/connectors/introduction.mdx/#integrated-connectors) do not need to be deployed, and are
available for immediate use in any project. You can see a full list of integrated connectors on the
[Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors).

## HTTP connectors

### Deploy an HTTP connector via a cloud provider

[HTTP connectors](/connectors/introduction.mdx/#http-connectors) can easily be deployed to a variety of cloud providers.
Simply follow the deployment instructions of your chosen provider.

### Deploy an HTTP connector via Hasura using the CLI

You can also deploy them to Hasura using our `connector` CLI plugin. You can see a full list of HTTP connectors on the
[Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors).

Open source repositories that are set up according to the connector convention can be used via the `connector` CLI
plugin.

:::info Curious about an example?

See the [SendGrid connector's repository](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sendgrid/tree/main#sendgrid-connector) to see
how the connector is set up.

:::

Once you have the Hasura v3 CLI you can install the plugin as follows:

```bash
hasura3 plugin install connector
```

### Limit access to your connector

You can set the `SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET` environment variable to only allow use from authorized Hasura projects.

Set the environment variable on creation:

```
hasura3 connector create my-connector:v1 \
  --github-repo-url https://github.com/hasura/cool-connector/tree/v0.7 \
  --config-file conf.json \
  --env SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET='MY-SECRET-TOKEN-XXX123'
```

Configure your Hasura project metadata with a matching bearer token:

```yaml
kind: DataSource
name: sendgrid
dataConnectorUrl:
  url: "https://my-connector-9XXX7-hyc5v23h6a-ue.a.run.app"
auth:
  type: Bearer
  token: "SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN_XXX123"
```

Or via the Hasura secrets functionality:

```yaml
kind: DataSource
name: sendgrid
dataConnectorUrl:
  url: "https://my-connector-9XXX7-hyc5v23h6a-ue.a.run.app"
auth:
  type: Bearer
  token:
    valueFromSecret: CONNECTOR_TOKEN
```

You can set a secret with the CLI for your cloud projects:

```
hasura3 cloud secret set --project-id $project-id CONNECTOR_TOKEN=SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN_XXX123
```
