# Connectors on the Hasura Hub

Hasura maintains a directory of [available and upcoming v3 Connectors](https://hasura.io/connectors/). This provides a
searchable and browsable index of connector versions. Each connector listed also has a details page with deployment
instructions.

The following instructions will explain how to have a connector listed on the connectors directory.

## Authoring your connector

Follow the <VersionedLink to="/connectors/build-your-own-connector/">Build your own Connector</VersionedLink> guide for
instructions on how to write a connector.

## Setting up a connector repository

Currently, a connector must be published as an open source repository on GitHub.

This should include the following:

- A `README.md` documenting what the connector is, and how to use it.
- A `Dockerfile` that builds and runs your connector in the context of the `connector` plugin.

:::info Dockerfile Requirements

If your connector relies on the `--volume` feature from the connector plugin, then your Dockerfile must **COPY** the
volume from a placeholder file/directory. This should be done as late in the Dockerfile as possible if you wish to
optimize for caching.

(See: [the NDC-Typescript-Deno Dockerfile](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-typescript-deno/blob/main/Dockerfile))

## Publishing your Connector on the Hasura Hub

All connectors listed on the Hasura Hub currently require an entry in the [ndc-hub repository
registry](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub/tree/main/registry). See the
[SendGrid Connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub/tree/main/registry/sendgrid) for an example.

Once your repository is set up and tested with the
[Connector CLI Plugin](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/hasura-cli/connector-plugin/) you should open a pull request
against the [NDC-Hub repo](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub) to add a directory representing your connector.

It should contain:

- A `README.md` file
  - This should be a condensed version of the `README.md` in your connector repository that acts as a quickstart guide
    for Hasura users.
- A `logo.png` file
  - This will appear next to your connector in the Connector Hub directory.
- A `metadata.json` file
  - This is used for indexing your connector and listing its published versions.

## Tagging your Connector Versions

The `"source_code"` key in the `metadata.json` lists published versions of your connector.

We recommend that you tag releases of your connector in your repository according to ["semver"](https://semver.org).

You should include the Git hash of the version you are tagging so that stealth updates cannot be released without
review.

- `is_open_source` should be `true`, and
- `is_verified` should be `false`

For example:

```
    "source_code":{
        "is_open_source": true,
        "repository":"https://github.com/foo/bar/",
        "version":[
            {
                "tag": "v0.2",
                "hash": "c0b3f13893e24a41df084985908af7ced0265498",
                "is_verified": false
            },
            {
                "tag":"v0.1",
                "hash":"8dc16c427e4e0136ebf0cfba1de3831c7939befb",
                "is_verified": false
            }
        ]
    }
```

You can update your connector with new tags and details at any time, however all PRs will be reviewed by Hasura for the
immediate future.

## Verifying your Connector

Please mark `"is_verified": false` in your connector metadata on initial publication.

If you wish to have your connector verified then you can raise this in the pull request discussion, or
[open an issue](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub/issues/new).

More information about partnering with Hasura to have a verified version of your connector listed will be available
soon.

## Maintaining your Connector

If you wish to have your connector listed on the Hasura Hub, you should commit to making a best-effort to maintain the
connector to ensure that it is up-to-date with respect to:

- Hasura Compatibility
- Relevant Security Updates

The updates should be released as new versions of your connector.
