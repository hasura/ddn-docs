## 1. Introduction

This guide details the automated process for publishing new connectors and updating existing versions on the [Hasura Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors) and in the Hasura DDN documentation.

## 2. Prerequisites

This document assumes that you have either:

- Developed a new connector or
- Developed a new version of an existing connector

## 3. Automated Publication Process Overview

The automated publication process simplifies and accelerates the deployment of NDC connectors by:

- Managing documentation updates
- Streamlining the approval workflow
- Uploading connector packages to Hasura DDN
- Updating the Hasura Hub Registry database so connectors can be deployed on DDN
- Making a new connector/connector version available in the DDN ecosystem

## 4. `connector-packaging.json` Format

To package a connector, you will need to create a `connector-packaging.json` file for each connector version. The file contains necessary information to access the package definition. Here's the required format:

```
{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "uri": "https://github.com/hasura/ndc-mongodb/releases/download/v0.0.1/connector-definition.tgz",
    "checksum": {
        "type": "sha256",
        "value": "2cd3584557be7e2870f3488a30cac6219924b3f7accd9f5f473285323843a0f4"
    },
    "source": {
        "hash": "c32adbde478147518f65ff465c40a0703239288a"
    }
}
```

Required fields:

- `version`: The version of the connector (e.g., "1.0.0").
- `uri`: The URL to download the connector package. This should be a tarball containing the connector package definition and must be accessible without authentication.
- `checksum`: The checksum of the connector package.
  - `type`: The algorithm used for the checksum (currently only "sha256" is supported).
  - `value`: The actual checksum value.
- `source`: Information about the source code used to build the package.
  - `hash`: The commit hash of the source code used to build the connector package.

Ensure all fields are correctly filled out for each new connector version you publish.

## 5. Creating a New Connector

To add a new connector to the registry, follow these steps:

### 5.1 Prepare Connector Files

1. Create a new folder structure in the `registry` directory:

```
registry/
  └── [namespace]/
      └── [connector-name]/
```

   Replace `[namespace]` with your organization's namespace and `[connector-name]` with the name of your connector.



2. Add the following files to your connector's folder:

   - `logo.png` or `logo.svg`: The logo for your connector (preferably in SVG format).
   - `README.md`: Documentation for your connector, including description, usage instructions, and any other relevant information.
   - `metadata.json`: Metadata file containing information about the connector.

### 5.2 Create Connector Metadata

Create a `metadata.json` file in your connector's folder. This file contains crucial information about your connector and the data present in this file is going to appear on the connector’s home page at the [connector hub](http://hasura.io/connectors). Here's a detailed structure with explanations:

```
{
  "overview": {
    "namespace": "your_namespace",
    "description": "A brief description of your connector",
    "title": "Your Connector Title",
    "logo": "logo.png",
    "tags": [],
    "latest_version": "v1.0.0"
  },
  "author": {
    "support_email": "support@example.com",
    "homepage": "https://www.example.com",
    "name": "Your Organization Name"
  },
  "is_verified": false,
  "is_hosted_by_hasura": false,
  "source_code": {
    "is_open_source": true,
    "repository": "https://github.com/your-org/your-connector-repo"
  }
}
```

Field explanations:

- `overview`: General information about your connector.

  - `namespace`: Your organization's namespace (e.g. sqlserver for the SQL Server connector)
  - `description`: A brief description of your connector.
  - `title`: The title of your connector (E.g. BigQuery, SQL Server)
  - `logo`: Filename containing your connector logo (Acceptable formats are: PNG, SVG).
  - `tags`: Keywords related to your connector.
  - `latest_version`: The most recent version of your connector.


- `author`: Information about the connector's author or organization.

- `is_verified`: Set this to false as only connectors developed by Hasura can be tagged as verified.Boolean indicating if the connector is verified by Hasura (initially set to `false`).

- `is_hosted_by_hasura`: Set this to false as connectors not developed by Hasura cannot be hostednot Hasura Boolean indicating if the connector can be hosted by Hasura.

- `source_code`: Information about the connector's source code.

  - `is_open_source`: Set this to true as all connectors have to be open-source. Boolean indicating if the connector is open source.
  - `repository`: URL of the source code repository.

### 5.3 Add Initial Connector Version

1. Create a `releases` folder in your connector's directory.
2. Follow the steps in Section 6.2 to add your first connector version.

### 5.4 Submit for Review

1. Commit all your changes to a new branch.
2. Create a pull request targeting the `main` branch of the repository.
3. In the pull request description, provide any additional context about your new connector.
4. Wait for review and approval from the Hasura team.

### 5.5 Post-Approval Process

Once your pull request is approved and merged:

1. The new connector will be added to the Hasura Hub Registry.
2. It will become available in the staging environment for testing.
3. After successful testing, it will be published to the production environment.

## 6. Creating new releases for existing connectors and updating documentation and logo of the existing connectors

### 6.1 Repository Structure

Ensure your connector and connector versions follow the following directory structure:

```
registry/
  ├── [namespace]/
  │   ├── [connector-name]/
  │   │   ├── releases/
  │   │   │   ├── [version]/
  │   │   │   │   └── connector-packaging.json
  │   │   ├── logo.(png|svg)
  │   │   └── README.md
```

### 6.2 Creating a New Connector Version

1. Create a new folder under `registry/[namespace]/[connector-name]/releases/` with the version number.
2. The version must start with the letter 'v', for example: `v1.0.0`.
3. Add a `connector-packaging.json` file in this folder with the connector metadata.

### 6.3 Updating Connector Information

- To update the logo: Modify the `logo.png` or `logo.svg` file in the connector's root folder.
- To update the documentation: Modify the `README.md` file in the connector's root folder.

### 6.4 Creating a Pull Request

1. Commit your changes to a new branch.
2. Create a pull request targeting the `main` branch.
3. Wait for approval from a Hasura team member.

### 6.5 Automated Process

Once the pull request is approved, the GitHub workflow will automatically:

1. Check for PR approvals
2. Identify changed files
3. Run the registry automation program
4. Upload connector packages
5. Update the Hasura Hub Registry database

## 7. Automation Trigger Process

The connector publication automation is designed to run automatically for every commit made to a pull request targeting the `main` branch. This process ensures that your changes are continuously validated and updated in the staging environment. Here's how it works:

### 7.1 Pull Request Creation

When you create a pull request against the `main` branch with changes in the `registry` folder, it triggers the automation process.

### 7.2 Commit-Based Triggers

Every new commit to the pull request will trigger the `registry-update` GitHub Actions workflow. This includes:

- Initial commits when opening the PR
- Additional commits pushed to the same PR
- Commits made in response to review comments

### 7.3 Staging Environment Updates

For each commit:

1. The `registry-update` workflow runs automatically.
2. It validates the changes in the `registry` folder, including the `connector-packaging.json` file.
3. If validation is successful, it updates the connector information in the Staging Hasura DDN.
4. Each new commit overwrites the previous version of that connector in the staging DDN.

### 7.4 Continuous Updates

This process allows for continuous iteration and testing in the staging environment:

- You can push multiple commits to refine your connector changes.
- Each commit provides a new opportunity to test and verify your changes in the staging environment.
- Reviewers can check the latest version of your connector in the staging DDN at any time during the review process.

### 7.5 Production Deployment

Once the pull request is approved and merged into the `main` branch:

- The final version of the connector (based on the last commit in the PR) is automatically published to the Production Hasura DDN.
- This process ensures that only thoroughly reviewed and tested connector versions reach the production environment.

### 7.6 Important Notes

- The automation only triggers for changes made in the `registry` folder.
- Ensure your `connector-packaging.json` file is valid for each commit to avoid automation failures.
- You can use the staging environment to thoroughly test your connector before it reaches production.
- Multiple connector versions or updates to multiple connectors can be included in a single PR, and the automation will handle all changes appropriately.

## 7. Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

- Issue: Pull request automation doesn't trigger
  Solution: Ensure the PR targets the `main` branch and modifies files under the `registry/` directory
- Issue: Automation fails due to missing environment variables
  Solution: Ping Karthikeyan Chinnakonda/Vishnu Bharathi on GitHub.

## 8. FAQs

Q: How long does the automation process take?
A: The process typically takes a few minutes, depending on the size of the connector package and the number of changes.

Q: Can I publish multiple connector versions in one PR?
A: Yes, you can include multiple versions or even multiple connectors in a single pull request.

Q: What happens if the automation process fails?
A: The process will attempt to clean up any partially uploaded files and will not update the registry database. Check the GitHub Actions log for detailed error messages.
