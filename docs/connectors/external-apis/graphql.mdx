# GraphQL Connector

## Introduction

Using the Hasura [GraphQL Connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-graphql), you can instantly bring an existing GraphQL
API into a Hasura DDN supergraph API.

The GraphQL Connector replaces the [Remote Schemas](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/remote-schemas/overview/)
functionality from Hasura v2 and can also be used to bring in an existing Hasura v2 GraphQL API into Hasura DDN.

The connector translates the root-fields of a GraphQL schema to NDC
[functions](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/schema/functions.html) and
[procedures](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/schema/procedures.html). This results in your GraphQL root
fields being exposed as [commands](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/supergraph-modeling/commands) in the supergraph. This
simplifies implementation and acts as a proxy more than a
[model](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/supergraph-modeling/models).

The recent support for field arguments and header forwarding on
[Hasura v3 engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/v3) allow the connector to represent the
majority of queries and mutations.

The connector is built using the [Rust Native Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub#rusk-sdk) and
implements the [Native Data Connector Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec).

## Getting started

To get started with the GraphQL Data Connector, you can follow the
[guide here](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx).

:::info Prerequisites

If you've never used Hasura DDN, we recommend that you first go through the
[getting started](/getting-started/overview.mdx). üòä

## Configuration Overview

The configuration comprises the following files:

- `configuration.json` - Main configuration file. This is where you'll set up the connection to your underlying
  endpoint.
- `configuration.schema.json` - [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) for your main configuration file. Allows your
  IDE to validate your configuration file, enhancing your configuration experience.
- `schema.graphql` - Stored GraphQL introspection. This file should be mostly left alone.

### Introspection connection & execution connection

You may wish to connect to different endpoints for introspection and query execution. This can be the case if, for
example, you want to introspect a locally running copy of your graphql endpoint. Additionally, you may wish to set
certain static headers for introspection only.

To that end, the configuration contains both an execution and introspection connection configuration.

### Request header forwarding

You may wish to forward headers from the original request to the underlying connector. To achieve this, set the
`request.forwardHeaders` property to a non-empty array of string values. Glob patterns are supported.

You will also have to modify your [connector link](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links/) to add the following
[argument preset](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx#dataconnectorlink-dataconnectorargumentpreset) section:

```yaml
kind: DataConnectorLink
version: v1
definition:
  # add this section
  argumentPresets:
    - argument: _headers
      value:
        httpHeaders:
          # list desired headers to forward
          forward:
            - Cookie
            - Authorization
            - X-Hasura-Admin-Secret
          additional: {}
```

Note the `_headers` argument name. This argument must not conflict with any root field arguments in your target schema.
If there is a conflict, you may change this name in both your connector link, and your connector's `configuration.json`
file

:::tip

Changing this configuration will modify the exposed NDC schema, which you will need to
[update](/cli/commands/ddn_connector-link_update/).

Only do this _after_ making the [connector link](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links/) changes described above.

:::

### Response header forwarding

You may want to forward request headers back to the client, typically when using the `Set-Cookie` header. To achieve
this, set the `response.forwardHeaders` property to a non-empty array of string values. Glob patterns are supported.

You will also have to modify your [connector link](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links/) to add the
[response header](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx#dataconnectorlink-responseheaders) section:

```yaml
kind: DataConnectorLink
version: v1
definition:
  # add this section
  responseHeaders:
    headersField: headers
    resultField: response
    # list desired headers to forward
    forwardHeaders:
      - Set-Cookie
```

:::tip

Changing this configuration will modify the exposed NDC schema, which you will need to
[update](/cli/commands/ddn_connector-link_update/).

Only do this _after_ making the [connector link](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links/) changes described above.

:::

:::warning

Note that returning multiple headers with the same name is not supported. Only the last header of a given name will be
returned.

This may be a problem when using the `Set-Cookie` header.

This limitation will be remedied in the future.
