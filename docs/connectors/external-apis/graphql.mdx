# GraphQL Connector

## Introduction

Using the Hasura [GraphQL Connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-graphql), you can instantly bring an existing GraphQL
API into a Hasura DDN supergraph API.

The GraphQL Connector replaces the [Remote Schemas](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/remote-schemas/overview/)
functionality from Hasura v2 and can also be used to bring in an existing Hasura v2 GraphQL API into Hasura DDN.

The connector translates the root-fields of a GraphQL schema to NDC
[functions](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/schema/functions.html) and
[procedures](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/schema/procedures.html). This results in your GraphQL root
fields being exposed as [commands](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/supergraph-modeling/commands) in the supergraph. This
simplifies implementation and acts as a proxy more than a
[model](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/supergraph-modeling/models).

The recent support for field arguments and header forwarding on
[Hasura v3 engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/v3) allow the connector to represent the
majority of queries and mutations.

The connector is built using the [Rust Native Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-hub#rusk-sdk) and
implements the [Native Data Connector Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec).
