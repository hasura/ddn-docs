# OpenAPI Connector

## Introduction

Using the Hasura [OpenAPI Lambda Connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-open-api-lambda), you can instantly import
OpenAPI-compliant APIs into your GraphQL API. Any `GET` requests are tagged as `@readonly` using the Node.js Lambda
connector and are exposed as queries in your GraphQL API. All others are then exposed as procedures, allowing you to
mutate data.

## Features

- Convert Open API/swagger documentation into Typescript functions compatible with NodeJS Lambda Connector
- Supported request types

| Request Type | Query | Path | Body | Headers |
| ------------ | ----- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| GET          | âœ…    | âœ…   | NA   | âœ…      |
| POST         | âœ…    | âœ…   | âœ…   | âœ…      |
| DELETE       | âœ…    | âœ…   | âœ…   | âœ…      |
| PUT          | âœ…    | âœ…   | âœ…   | âœ…      |
| PATCH        | âœ…    | âœ…   | âœ…   | âœ…      |

## Getting started

To get started with the OpenAPI Lambda Connector, you can follow the
[guide here](/getting-started/build/03-connect-to-data/01-connect-a-source.mdx?db=OpenAPI).
