# Auth0

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to configure an existing [Auth0 application](https://auth0.com) and generate a JWT
which you can pass in the header of your requests to Hasura. After setting up your
[AuthConfig](/reference/metadata-reference/auth-config.mdx) object to use JWT mode, this will allow you to validate
users' identities and create [permission rules](/reference/metadata-reference/permissions.mdx) which can limit access to
underlying data served by Hasura DDN.

:::info Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have:

- An Auth0 [application](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard).
- A local application that you're actively developing, built with any language or framework supported by
  [Auth0's SDKs](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries).
- A local Hasura DDN project.

:::

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Create a new Auth0 application

From your Auth0 dashboard, click `Applications` in the sidebar and then click on `Create Application`. Enter a name for
your application, then choose the application type that best suits your needs.

After creating the application, go to `APIs` in the sidebar and create a new API with your GraphQL endpoint as the
identifier.

### Step 2. Create a new Auth0 Action

From your Auth0 dashboard, click `Actions` in the sidebar and choose `Triggers`.

Under `Sign Up & Login`, select the `post-login` trigger, click on the `+` icon, and then choose `Built from Scratch` to
create a new Action.

Enter a name for your Action such as `Hasura JWT Claims` and paste the following code:

```javascript
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const namespace = "claims.jwt.hasura.io";
  // Here, you'll need to fetch the user's role from Hasura DDN using an admin-level authenticated request
  // Learn more here: https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/auth/authentication/jwt/special-roles
  // Below, we're hard-coding the value for now
  const user_role = "user"; // the role returned from your request ☝️
  api.idToken.setCustomClaim(namespace, {
    "x-hasura-default-role": user_role,
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": [user_role],
    "x-hasura-user-id": event.user.user_id,
    // Add any other custom claims you wish to include
  });

  // Set the necessary access token claims for Hasura to authenticate the user
  api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(namespace, {
    "x-hasura-default-role": user_role,
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": [user_role],
    "x-hasura-user-id": event.user.user_id,
  });
};
```

This will add the required Hasura namespace with the keys that Hasura DDN expects when decoding a JWT. You can modify
the keys to suit your Hasura DDN [roles](/reference/metadata-reference/permissions.mdx#typepermissions).

Click `Deploy`.

:::tip Custom claims

You can create any custom keys you wish and reference them in your permissions using session variables. Above,
`x-hasura-user-id` is simply an example. Any claim prefixed with `x-hasura-` is accessible to the Hasura DDN Engine.

:::

### Step 3. Update your AuthConfig

Update your AuthConfig object to use JWT mode and your
[Auth0 JWKs](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-key-sets):

```yaml
kind: AuthConfig
version: v2
definition:
  mode:
    jwt:
      claimsConfig:
        namespace:
          claimsFormat: Json
          location: "/claims.jwt.hasura.io"
      issuer: "<your Auth0 tenant's URL>"
      key:
        jwkFromUrl: "https://<your Auth0 tenant's URL>/.well-known/jwks.json"
      audience: ["<your GraphQL endpoint>"]
      tokenLocation:
        type: Header
        name: Auth-Token
```

Then, create a new build of your supergraph:

```sh
ddn supergraph build local
```

### Step 4. Test your configuration

The easiest way to verify your setup is to generate a new JWT by logging into your client application that uses Auth0.
These values aren't typically displayed to users, so you'll need to log them while in development. You can then add that
value as a header in the console and test any permissions you have in your metadata. If you're unfamiliar with this, we
have a sample repo [here](https://github.com/hasura/ddn-auth-examples/tree/main/auth0).

:::info Auth0 API Debugger

Auth0 does provide an extension: the `Auth0 Authentication API Debugger` for testing configurations. However, custom
claims have been known to cause issues. You can find more information about using their debugger
[here](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/extensions/authentication-api-debugger-extension).

:::

### Step 5. Service account access token (optional)

In certain cases, you may need to generate a service account access token to access your Hasura DDN supergraph when
performing backend operations. You can do this by creating a new Auth0 application named `Service Account` with a type
of `Machine to Machine Applications`.

After creating the application, go to `Triggers`, located underneath `Actions` in the sidebar, and click on the
`credentials-exchange` trigger. Similar to the `post-login` trigger, create a new Action and paste the code below:

```javascript
exports.onExecuteCredentialsExchange = async (event, api) => {
  const namespace = "claims.jwt.hasura.io";

  const service_role = "service_account";

  api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(namespace, {
    "x-hasura-default-role": service_role,
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": [service_role],
  });
};
```

This will generate a new JWT token with the `service_account` role which can then be used to access your Hasura DDN
supergraph.

You can generate a new access token using the following Python code:

```python
import http.client

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("<Auth0 domain>")

payload = "{\"client_id\":\"<client id>\",\"client_secret\":\"<Auth0 Client Secret>\",\"audience\":\"<your GraphQL endpoint>\",\"grant_type\":\"client_credentials\"}"

headers = { 'content-type': "application/json" }

conn.request("POST", "/oauth/token", payload, headers)

res = conn.getresponse()
data = res.read()

print(data.decode("utf-8"))
```

The response will look like:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<service account access token>",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

You can modify your metadata to allow the `service_account` role to access the necessary models.

:::tip Best Practices for Service Accounts

Instead of granting a service account full admin access, create a custom role with only the necessary permissions. This
approach follows the principle of least privilege, thereby limiting potential impact in case of any errors or
oversights.

## Wrapping up

In this guide, you learned how to integrate Auth0 with Hasura DDN to create a secure and scalable identity management
solution using JWTs. By leveraging custom claims in conjunction with
[permissions](/reference/metadata-reference/permissions.mdx), you can define precise access-control rules, ensuring that
your application remains secure and meets your users' needs.

As you continue building out your supergraph, keep in mind that authentication and authorization are crucial components.
Always validate your configuration and regularly test your setup to ensure it functions as expected across different
roles and environments.

If you encounter issues or need further customization, consider reviewing our related documentation or exploring
additional Auth0 features that can enhance your authentication flows.
