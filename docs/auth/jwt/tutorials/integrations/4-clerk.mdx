# Clerk

## Introduction

In this {{ tutorial }}, you'll learn how to configure an existing [Clerk application](https://clerk.com/) and generate a
JWT which you can pass in the header of your requests to Hasura. After setting up your
[AuthConfig](/supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx) object to use JWT mode, this will allow you to validate users'
identities and create [permission rules](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx) which can limit access to underlying data
served by Hasura DDN.

:::info Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have:

- A [Clerk application](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- A local application that can integrate with Clerk for authentication.
- A local Hasura DDN project.

### Step 1. Create a JWT template

From your [Clerk application's dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/), click `JWT templates` in the sidenav and create
a new blank template. You can name this whatever you wish along with configuring properties like the token's lifetime,
clock skew, etc.

In the claims editor, add the following:

```javascript
{
	"claims.jwt.hasura.io": {
		"x-hasura-user-id": "{{user.id}}",
		"x-hasura-default-role": "user",
		"x-hasura-allowed-roles": [
			"user"
		]
	}
}
```

This will add the required Hasura namespace with the keys that Hasura DDN expects when decoding a JWT. You can modify
the keys to suit your Hasura DDN [roles](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#typepermissions).

You can also see that we're hard-coding the user's role. You can dynamically set a user's role using Clerk's metadata to
set a `role` field on the `User` object whenever a user registers. You can learn more
[here](https://clerk.com/docs/users/metadata).

This enables you to then pass the value of `{{user.publicMetadata.role}}` in the custom claims of the JWT.

:::tip Custom claims

You can create any custom keys you wish and reference them in your permissions using session variables. Above,
`x-hasura-user-id` is simply an example. Any claim prefixed with `x-hasura-` is accessible to the Hasura DDN Engine.

### Step 2. Update your AuthConfig

Update your AuthConfig object to use JWT mode and your Clerk JWKs, which rely on your Clerk domain name found in the
sidenav under `Domains`:

```yaml
kind: AuthConfig
version: v2
definition:
  mode:
    jwt:
      claimsConfig:
        namespace:
          claimsFormat: Json
          location: "/claims.jwt.hasura.io"
      key:
        jwkFromUrl: "https://<your-clerk-domain>/.well-known/jwks.json"
      tokenLocation:
        type: Header
        name: Auth-Token
```

Then, create a new build of your supergraph:

```sh
ddn supergraph build local
```

### Step 3. Test your configuration

Generate a new JWT by logging into your application. These values aren't typically displayed to users, so you'll need to
log them while in development. You can then add that value as a header in the console and test any permissions you have
in your metadata.

Clerk's [various SDKs](https://clerk.com/docs/references/overview) make this easy, as you can pass the name of a JWT
template and get back the encoded token.

```javascript title="As an example, using the JavaScript SDK:"
const jwt = await session.getToken({ template: "hasura" });
```

## Wrapping up

In this guide, you learned how to integrate Clerk with Hasura DDN to create a secure and scalable identity management
solution using JWTs. By leveraging custom claims in conjunction with
[permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx), you can define precise access-control rules, ensuring that your
application remains secure and meets your users' needs.

As you continue building out your supergraph, keep in mind that authentication and authorization are crucial components.
Always validate your configuration and regularly test your setup to ensure it functions as expected across different
roles and environments.

If you encounter issues or need further customization, consider reviewing our related documentation or exploring
additional Clerk features that can enhance your authentication flows.
