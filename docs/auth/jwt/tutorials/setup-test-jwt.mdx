# Set up a JWT for Testing

By default, your supergraph uses your Hasura Cloud authentication token, also known as a personal access token (PAT),
for authentication. This is convenient for testing from the console but should not be used in an application or shared
with others.

Instead, to test authentication you need to set up an
[`AuthConfig` object](/reference/metadata-reference/auth-config.mdx) and then generate the corresponding token.

## Step 1: Install the jwt-cli

Install the [`jwt-cli`](https://github.com/mike-engel/jwt-cli), which allows you to generate tokens from the command
line. You can follow their list of installation instructions found
[here](https://github.com/mike-engel/jwt-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

## Step 2: Generate a random string

Generate a random string that we'll use as the JWT secret key:

```bash title="In your teminal, run the following command"
openssl rand -hex 16
```

Copy the value returned by the terminal.

:::info Creating a random string

If you don't want to use openssl, you can use any other random string generators. The only requirement is that the
string must be at least 32 characters.

## Step 3: Set up your AuthConfig object

Set up an `AuthConfig` object in your project which uses this secret key.

```yaml title="In globals/metadata/auth-config.hml:"
kind: AuthConfig
version: v4
definition:
  mode:
    jwt:
      claimsConfig:
        namespace:
          claimsFormat: Json
          location: "/claims.jwt.hasura.io"
      key:
        fixed:
          algorithm: HS256
          key:
            value: "<insert-the-key-generated-in-previous-step>"
      tokenLocation:
        type: Header
        name: Auth-Token
```

## Step 4: Create a new supergraph build

Create a supergraph build using this `AuthConfig`.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn supergraph build create \
  --description "use jwt-based authconfig" \
  --supergraph supergraph.yaml
```

## Step 5: Generate a JWT

For testing, you can use the `jwt-cli` to encode and generate a new token with the different claims written to match
your testing needs.

```bash title="Run the following with your own values:"
jwt encode --secret="<secret-key>" '{"exp": 1739905122,"iat": 1708369122,"claims.jwt.hasura.io":{"x-hasura-default-role": "admin","x-hasura-allowed-roles":["admin"]}}'
```

In the example above, we're setting the following values:

- The issued (`iat`) time as `Feb. 19 2024, at 18:58:42` as a Unix epoch timestamp.
- The expiration (`exp`) time as `Feb. 18, 2025 at 18:58:42`.
- The default role as `admin`.
- The allowed roles as `admin`.

For more information about the claims Hasura expects, check out [this page](/auth/jwt/jwt-configuration.mdx).

## Step 6: Test your AuthConfig

In the Hasura console, add the JWT generated by the console as the value of a new header called `Auth-token` on the
GraphiQL explorer. You should now be able to execute queries with your custom JWT.

:::info Using environment variables

If you're storing your secret key's value as an environment variable, ensure you've updated the `subgraph.yaml` in the
`globals` subgraph to include this envMapping.
