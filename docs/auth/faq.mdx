# Frequently Asked Questions about Auth

## Should I choose JWT or Webhook mode?

JWT mode is recommended for most use cases. It's easy to set up, integrates with many 3rd party providers and provides a
robust security model.

Webhook mode is more flexible and can be useful for custom authentication scenarios. Webhook mode will be slightly
slower than JWT mode due to the additional network request.

## How do I test permissions with JWT mode?

You can test permissions directly in the Hasura Console's API interface:

1. Define the desired permissions for a particular Type, Model, or Command in your metadata.
2. Create a new build of your supergraph.
3. Make a request through the Hasura DDN Console GraphiQL API interface with an auth token that includes the required
   session variables.
4. Check the returned data to ensure it adheres to your permission configurations.

Read more about setting up a test token in the [JWT mode tutorial](/auth/jwt/tutorials/setup-test-jwt.mdx).

## How do I create a new role?

A role comes into existence when it is defined in one of TypePermissions, ModelPermissions, or CommandPermissions.

## How do I delete a role?

To delete a role, you need to remove the role from all TypePermissions, ModelPermissions, and CommandPermissions
objects.

## How do I enable a fully open production API where any user can query anything without any auth in their queries?

Use [NoAuth](/auth/noauth-mode.mdx) mode and set the API to public via the console in Settings > Summary > API Access
Mode or by using the `ddn project set-api-access-mode public` command.

## How do I enable a **mostly** fully public API with no authentication but where **some** fields are not public?

Enable webhook mode and for any query which doesn't have auth header properties assign the `public` session variable
role in the response. For any user query with proper auth, assign the appropriate role.

## How do I enable a secure API with JWT mode but where some fields are fully public?

In this case queries to “public” fields still need a valid JWT.
