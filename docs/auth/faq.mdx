# Frequently Asked Questions about Auth

## How do I test permissions?

You can test permissions directly in the Hasura Console's API interface:

1. Define the desired permissions for a particular type, model, or command in your metadata.
2. Make a request through the Hasura DDN Console GraphiQL API interface with an auth token that resolves to the required
   session variables.
3. Check the returned data to ensure it adheres to your permission configurations.

## How do I create a new role?

A role comes into existence when it is defined in one of TypePermissions, ModelPermissions, or CommandPermissions.

## How do I delete a role?

To delete a role, you need to remove the role from all TypePermissions, ModelPermissions, and CommandPermissions
objects.

## How do I enable a fully open production API where any user can query anything without any auth in their queries?

Use [NoAuth](/auth/noauth-mode.mdx) mode.

## How do I enable a **mostly** fully public API with no authentication but where **some** fields are not public?

Enable webhook mode and for any query which doesn't have auth header properties assign the `public` session variable
role in the response. For any user query with proper auth, assign the appropriate role.

## How do I enable a secure API with JWT mode but where some fields are fully public?

In this case queries to “public” fields still need to come with a valid JWT.
