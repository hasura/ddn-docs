# Enabling Webhook Authentication

## Introduction

You can enable your Hasura DDN instance to use an auth webhook in just a few steps.

## Step 1. Shaping the webhook request and response

### Request

Your webhook should accept either a GET or POST request. Below is an example of the request headers your webhook might
process:

```json title="Example headers present in a POST request to your webhook endpoint"
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer some-token",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
}
```

When a request is sent to Hasura, these headers will be forwarded to your webhook.

### Parsing

Your webhook is then responsible for parsing, validating, and using the token passed in the header. It will need to:

- **Extract the Token:** Retrieve the Authorization header from the incoming request and extract the token.

- **Validate the Token:** Use a library or your own logic to validate the token. This involves verifying the token's
  signature and decoding its payload to extract user information.

### Response

Based on the validation result, the webhook will need to respond with either a `200` status code (for a valid token) or
a `401` status code (for an invalid or missing token).

To allow the GraphQL request to go through, your webhook must return a `200` status code. You should respond with
session variables beginning with `X-Hasura-*` in the body of your response. These will be available to your
[permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx) in Hasura.

You will, at least, need to set the `X-Hasura-Role` session variable to let the Hasura DDN know which role to use for
this request. Unlike [JWT auth mode](auth/authentication/jwt/index.mdx), you do not have to pass
`X-Hasura-Allowed-Roles` or `X-Hasura-Default-Role` session variables. This is because the webhook is called for each
request, allowing the auth service to easily switch the user role if needed.

In the example below the `X-Hasura-Is-Owner` and `X-Hasura-Custom` are examples of custom session variables which can be
used to enforce permissions in your supergraph.

```json title="Example response from your webhook to Hasura DDN"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "X-Hasura-User-Id": "25",
    "X-Hasura-Role": "user",
    "X-Hasura-Is-Owner": "true",
    "X-Hasura-Custom": "custom value"
}
```

## Step 2. Update your AuthConfig

Hasura utilizes an [AuthConfig](/supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx) object that allows you to define the
configuration for your authentication service. The `auth-config.hml` file can be found in your `globals`
directory.

You can use
[Hasura's VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura#:~:text=Hasura%20Language%20Server%20Extension%20for,%2C%20syntax%20highlighting%2C%20and%20more)
to scaffold out your `AuthConfig` object by typing `AuthConfig` and selecting this object from the list of available
options. As you navigate through the skeleton, you can type `CTRL+SPACEBAR` at any point to reveal options for the
different key-value pairs.

In the example below, we're demonstrating the authentication webhook that ships with Hasura for local development. You
can see that we're hitting the `validate-request` endpoint with a POST request.

```yaml title="supergraph-globals/auth-config.hml"
kind: AuthConfig
version: v1
definition:
  allowRoleEmulationBy: admin
  mode:
    webhook:
      url: http://auth_hook:3050/validate-request
      method: Post
```

:::info Other configuration options are available

What we've provided above is a sample configuration. However, there are many options available, which you can learn
about [here](/supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx#authconfig-authhookconfig).

:::

## Step 3. Rebuild your supergraph

Once you've updated your `auth-config.hml`, you can rebuild your supergraph and test it locally.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

## Step 4. Make an authenticated request

In the example above, we're using the `BearerAuthorization` method. As such, as we can make a request to our Hasura DDN
instance by including a header with the key-value of `Authorization: Bearer <our-encoded-token>`. For testing, you can
pass this value in the Hasura DDN console's header section.

:::tip Authentication is only part of the puzzle!

Hasura DDN empowers you to easily write your access-control rules, commonly known as authorization, using declarative
metadata. You can use the values passed in your response to then limit which
[models](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#modelpermissions-modelpermissions) and
[types](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#typepermissions-typepermissions) a user has access to with each request.
