# Authentication Using a Webhook

## Introduction

You can configure the Hasura DDN to use webhook mode in order to authenticate incoming requests.

This process of using webhook mode for authentication with Hasura requires specifying a URL - which Hasura calls with
the original request headers - that then returns a body containing the user information in session variables.

The webhook service will use your request headers to determine the auth status of the user and return the user role and
any other information as session variables in the response body.
