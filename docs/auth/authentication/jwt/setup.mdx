# Enabling JWT Authentication

## Introduction

You can enable your Hasura DDN instance to use JWTs in just a few steps.

## Step 1. Create the claims

Your auth service should include an object with a key of `https://hasura.io/jwt/claims` in the JWT's claims. Within
this, each claim should be prefixed with `x-hasura-*` and include the relevant information.

| Key                      | Required | Value                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x-hasura-default-role`  | Yes      | The role that will be used when the optional x-hasura-role header is not passed |
| `x-hasura-allowed-roles` | Yes      | A list of allowed roles for the user making the request.                        |
| `x-hasura-[custom]`      | No       | Where `[custom]` is any value you wish (e.g., `org`, `user-id`, `customer`).    |

As an example, we're including the required claims by stating the default role is `user` and the list of available roles
is limited to `user` and `admin`. Additionally, we're passing a custom key of `x-hasura-user-id` which can be used with
[permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx) when executing queries.

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": false,
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-default-role": "user",
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["user", "admin"],
    "x-hasura-user-id": "1234"
  }
}
```

Your auth server will encode this object using a secret and create a token which can then be passed as a header to
Hasura or any other service. You can see an example of the above token encoded
[here](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOmZhbHNlLCJpYXQiOjE1MTYyMzkwMjIsImh0dHBzOi8vaGFzdXJhLmlvL2p3dC9jbGFpbXMiOnsieC1oYXN1cmEtZGVmYXVsdC1yb2xlIjoidXNlciIsIngtaGFzdXJhLWFsbG93ZWQtcm9sZXMiOlsidXNlciIsImFkbWluIl0sIngtaGFzdXJhLXVzZXItaWQiOiIxMjM0In19.XP5eM7AVk-w91rL-oWvPSo7m8pmJ4Is2V-NDS8-NlMo).

## Step 2. Update your AuthConfig

Hasura utilizes an [`AuthConfig` object](/supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx) that allows you to define the
configuration for your authentication service. The `auth-config.hml` file can be found in your `supergraph-globals`
directory.

You can use
[Hasura's VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura#:~:text=Hasura%20Language%20Server%20Extension%20for,%2C%20syntax%20highlighting%2C%20and%20more)
to scaffold out your `AuthConfig` object by typing `AuthConfig` and selecting this object from the list of available
options. As you navigate through the skeleton, you can type `CTRL+SPACEBAR` at any point to reveal options for the
different key-value pairs.

Below, we're demonstrating using the `BearerAuthorization` format with an `HS256` encryption algorithm (the most common
format for signing and passing JWTs). However, Hasura DDN supports other methods for both
[identifying](supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx#authconfig-jwttokenlocation) and
[verifying JWTs](supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx#authconfig-jwtalgorithm). Note the secret used with the `value` key
should match that which is used to encode your JWT on your auth server.

```yaml title="supergraph-globals/auth-config.hml"
kind: AuthConfig
version: v1
definition:
  mode:
    jwt:
      claimsConfig:
        namespace:
          claimsFormat: Json
          location: /https:~1~1hasura.io~1jwt~1claims
      tokenLocation:
        type: BearerAuthorization
      key:
        fixed:
          algorithm: HS256
          key:
            value: YourSuperSecretStringForEncoding
```

:::info Other configuration options are available

What we've provided above is a sample configuration. However, there are many options available, which you can learn
about [here](/supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx#authconfig-jwtconfig).

:::

:::warning Setting audience check

Certain JWT providers (like Firebase) share JWKs between multiple tenants. They use the `aud` claim of JWT to specify
the intended tenant for the JWT. Setting the `audience` field in the Hasura JWT configuration will make sure that the
`aud` claim from the JWT is also checked during verification. Not doing this check will allow JWTs issued for other
tenants to be valid as well.

In these cases, you **MUST** set the `audience` field to appropriate value. **Failing to do so is a major security
vulnerability**. Learn how to set this [here](supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx#authconfig-jwtconfig).

## Step 3. Rebuild your supergraph

Once you've updated your `auth-config.hml`, you can rebuild your supergraph and test it locally.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

## Step 4. Make an authenticated request

In the example above, we're using the `BearerAuthorization` method. As such, as we can make a request to our Hasura DDN
instance by including a header with the key-value of `Authorization: Bearer <our-encoded-token>`. For testing, you can
pass this value in the Hasura DDN console's header section.

:::tip Authentication is only part of the puzzle!

Hasura DDN empowers you to easily write your access-control rules, commonly known as authorization, using declarative
metadata. You can use the values passed in your JWTs to then limit which
[Models](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#modelpermissions-modelpermissions) and
[Types](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#typepermissions-typepermissions) a user has access to with each request.
