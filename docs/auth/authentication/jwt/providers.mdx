# Providers

## Introduction

Hasura is designed to integrate with any JWT provider, including auth servers you've built yourself. However, there are
some provider-specific caveats to consider for those listed below.

## Firebase

This page of the Firebase
[docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens#verify_id_tokens_using_a_third-party_jwt_library)
mentions that JWKs are published under:

[https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com](https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com)

But that is a non-standard format. Firebase also publishes the same certificates as the proper JWK format under:

[https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com](https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com)

If you are using Firebase and Hasura, use this config:

```yaml title="supergraph_globals/auth-config.yaml"
jwkUrl: "https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com"
audience: "<firebase-project-id>"
issuer: "https://securetoken.google.com/<firebase-project-id>"
```

:::info Generate your JWT Config easily

You can generate your JWT config for Firebase and Hasura here using our [handy tool](https://hasura.io/jwt-config).

The config generated from this page can be directly pasted in yaml files and command line arguments as it takes care of
escaping new lines.

## Auth0 {#auth0-issues}

Auth0 publishes their JWK under:

`https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json`

But they have a
[bug where the certificate thumbprint does not match](https://community.auth0.com/t/certificate-thumbprint-is-longer-than-20-bytes/7794/3).
Hence, currently this URL does not work with Hasura.

Currently, the workaround is to download the X590 certificate from:

`https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/pem`

And use it in the `key` field:

```yaml title="supergraph_globals/auth-config.yaml"
type: "RS512"
key: |

## Clerk

Clerk integrates with Hasura GraphQL Engine using JWTs.

Clerk publishes their JWK under: `https://<YOUR_CLERK_FRONTEND_API>/.well-known/jwks.json`

Refer to the [Clerk authentication guide](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura-authentication/integrations/clerk/) to
set up authenticated requests to Hasura with Clerk.
