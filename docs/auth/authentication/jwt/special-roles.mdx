# Enabling Admin and Unauthenticated Requests

Each Hasura DDN project metadata is generated with an `admin` role by default which has access to all models, commands
and object types in your supergraph. On the other hand, there's no concept for unauthenticated access to a supergraph.
Below, we'll show you how to achieve both when using JWTs and Hasura DDN.

## Making admin-level requests

To make an admin-level request, after
[updating up your AuthConfig](/auth/authentication/jwt/setup.mdx#step-1-update-your-authconfig), shape your claims as
follows:

```json title="Claims configuration in your authentication service"

  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-default-role": "admin",
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["admin"],
  }
```

You can now use the JWT generated by your authentication service to make requests as the `admin` role.

:::info Your JWT claims should be unique for each role

When designing or implementing an auth server, it is crucial to generate JWTs with different claims for each user role
so that each token enables the appropriate data access permissions for that user.
