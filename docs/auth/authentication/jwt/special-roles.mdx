# Enabling Admin and Unauthenticated Requests

Each Hasura DDN project metadata is generated with an `admin` role by default which has access to all models, commands
and object types in your supergraph. On the other hand, there's no concept for unauthenticated access to a supergraph.
Below, we'll show you how to achieve both when using JWTs and Hasura DDN.

## Making admin-level requests

To make an admin-level request, after
[updating up your AuthConfig](/auth/authentication/jwt/setup.mdx#step-1-update-your-authconfig), shape your
claims as follows:

```json title="Claims configuration in your authentication service"

  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-default-role": "admin",
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["admin"],
  }
```

You can now use the JWT generated by your authentication service to make requests as the `admin` role.

:::info Your JWT claims should be unique for each role

When designing or implementing an auth server, it is crucial to generate JWTs with different claims for each user role so that each token enables the appropriate data access permissions for that user.

## Making unauthenticated requests

To make an unauthenticated request (i.e., one that is publicly accessible without any authentication), you'll need to do
a few things.

### Step 1. Create the claims

In your authentication server, you can provide a claims map that identifies the default role as `public`. This can be
any name you wish, so long as it's not a role (such as `admin`) that already exists.

```json title="JWT claims configuration in your authentication service"

  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-default-role": "public",
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["public"],
  }
```

### Step 2. Update ModelPermissions

For whatever [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) you'd like to publicly expose, add a
[`ModelPermissions`](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#modelpermissions-modelpermissions) rule for
the public role.

```yaml title="Example ModelPermission for an Events Model"
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Events
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
    #highlight-start
    - role: public
      select:
        filter: null
    #highlight-end
```

### Step 3. Update TypePermissions

Then, determine which [types](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx) you'd like to publicly expose by updating
[TypePermissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#typepermissions-typepermissions). Hasura DDN gives you the
ability to granularly determine which fields from each Model are available to each role.

```yaml title="Example TypePermissions for an Events Model"
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: Events
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - id
          - owner_id
          - created_at
          - updated_at
          - is_live
          - title
          - date
          - description
    #highlight-start
    - role: public
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - id
          - is_live
          - title
          - date
          - description
    #highlight-end
```

### Step 4. Rebuild your supergraph

Once you've updated your metadata files, you can rebuild your supergraph and test it locally.

```bash title="For example, from the root of your project, run:"
ddn supergraph build local \
  --supergraph supergraph.local.yaml \
  --output-dir engine \
  --subgraph-env-file my_subgraph:my_subgraph/.env.my_subgraph.local
```

### Step 5. Make an unauthenticated request

In [basic examples](auth/authentication/jwt/setup.mdx#step-1-update-your-authconfig), we're using the
`BearerAuthorization` method. As such, as we can make a request to our Hasura DDN instance by including a header with
the key-value of `Authorization: Bearer <our-encoded-token-with-the-public-claims>`. For testing, you can pass this
value in the Hasura DDN console's header section.
