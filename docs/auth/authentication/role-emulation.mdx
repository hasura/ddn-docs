# Role Emulation

## Introduction

You can configure authentication to allow certain roles to emulate other roles. This can be useful during development
to test access-control rules without setting up authentication.

To set up role emulation, the `AuthConfig` Hasura metadata object accepts a field called `allowRoleEmulationBy`.

When `allowRoleEmulationBy` is set up, Hasura will check for the value of the `x-hasura-role` session variable
which is returned in the webhook or JWT response to be equal to the value set in the `allowRoleEmulationBy`. If the
values are equal, then role emulation will be enabled for that request. 

When role emulation is enabled for a request, the session variables, including the role, will be used from 
the HTTP request headers instead of from the JWT or webhook.

### Role emulation scenario setup

In the example below, we set up role emulation for the `api_admin` role, allowing an `api_admin` to emulate any other
role:

```yaml
---
kind: AuthConfig
version: v1
definition:
  #highlight-start
  allowRoleEmulationBy: api_admin
  #highlight-end
  webhook:
    webhookUrl: https://myauth.service.com/validate-request

```

Then, the following GraphQL request is made with some session variables in the headers:

```http
POST /graphql HTTP/2.0
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <user-token>
#highlight-start
x-hasura-role: author
x-hasura-author-id: 2
#highlight-end

{
  "query": "query GetAuthor { author { id name } }",
  "variables": null,
  "operationName": "GetAuthor"
}
```

The session variables actually used in this request will depend on the values provided in the request headers and the
values returned by the authentication webhook.

### Role emulation scenario 1

Now, let's assume the authentication webhook responds with the following session variables for the request:

```json
{
  "x-hasura-role": "api_admin"
}
```

Then, because the `api_admin` role is allowed to emulate other roles, (as per the `allowRoleEmulationBy: api_admin`
value in our `AuthConfig`) the GraphQL request will be executed as the `author` role, because the `x-hasura-role: author`
value is set in the headers of the request, along with `x-hasura-author-id: 2`.

i.e. the query will be executed with:
```json
{
  "x-hasura-role": "author",
  "x-hasura-author-id": 2
}
```

### Role emulation scenario 2

If the authentication webhook response is as follows:

```json
{
  "x-hasura-role": "api_admin",
  "x-hasura-author-id": 1
}
```

Then even in this case, because the `api_admin` role is making the request and is allowed to emulate other roles,
the GraphQL request will be executed as the `author` role, as that is the role stipulated in the request headers. 

Also, the value of the session variable `x-hasura-author-id` will be 2 and not 1, as that is the value stipulated in the
request headers.

i.e. the query will be executed with:
```json
{
  "x-hasura-role": "author",
  "x-hasura-author-id": 2
}
```

### Role emulation scenario 3

To illustrate an unsuccessful emulation scenario; if the webhook response were the following:

```json
{
  "x-hasura-role": "user",
  "x-hasura-author-id": 1
}
```

Then, the GraphQL query will be executed as the `user` role and **only** the session variables from the authentication
webhook response will be considered. 

This is because the `user` role is not allowed to emulate other roles via HTTP request headers. All session variables
for this request will be extracted from the authentication webhook response

i.e. the query will be executed with:
```json
{
  "x-hasura-role": "user",
  "x-hasura-author-id": 1
}
