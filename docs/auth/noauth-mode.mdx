# NoAuth

## Introduction

NoAuth mode is a simple way to run your Hasura DDN instance without authentication. This is useful for testing or
development purposes or to run your Hasura supergraph API endpoint as fully public without any authentication.

:::danger Production Warning

Using NoAuth mode in production environments is not advisable unless you intend for your API to be completely public. If
your Hasura DDN supergraph contains any sensitive data, you should enable authentication and avoid using NoAuth mode in
production.

:::

When you create a new Hasura DDN project with the `ddn supergraph init` command, noAuth mode is enabled by default.

## Enabling NoAuth Mode

### Step 1. Update your AuthConfig

On a default, standard new Hasura DDN project you will find an `AuthConfig` file in your `config` directory already
configured for noAuth mode.

```yaml title="An AuthConfig for noAuth mode:"
kind: AuthConfig
version: v3
definition:
  mode:
    noAuth:
      role: admin
      sessionVariables: {}
```

#### `role`

The role to be assumed while running the engine in `noAuth` mode. If you intend for your production API to be fully
public, you can set this to a value such as `public` or `anonymous` so that it's explicit.
[Read more about the `Role` value](/reference/metadata-reference/auth-config.mdx#authconfig-role)

#### `sessionVariables`

Static session variables that will be used while running the engine without authentication. This is helpful when you
want to test requests using particular session variables, such as `x-hasura-user-id` with a non-admin role.
[Read more about the `SessionVariables` value](/reference/metadata-reference/auth-config.mdx#authconfig-sessionvariables)

### Step 2. Check permissions

On a default, standard new Hasura DDN project you will find permissions such as the below for an example `Posts` model:

```yaml title="TypePermissions:"
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: Posts
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - authorId
          - content
          - postId
          - title
```

```yaml title="ModelPermissions:"
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Posts
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
        allowSubscriptions: true
```

You can see that the `admin` role has full access to the `Posts` model with no filtering in the `ModelPermissions` and
all fields being allowed in the `TypePermissions`.

### Step 3. Build your supergraph

```bash
ddn supergraph build local
```

### Step 4. Make an un-authenticated request

```title="Open the Hasura DDN console and make a request:"
ddn console --local
```

<Thumbnail src="/img/auth/console-authorization-screen-noauth-mode.png" alt="NoAuth mode" width="1000px" />

If you click on the `Authorization` tab in the console, you can see that `NoAuth` mode is enabled and for this request,
the static session variables are not being used and all fields and data are being returned.
