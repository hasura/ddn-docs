# Limit Data to Users

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to configure [permissions](/reference/metadata-reference/permissions.mdx) to limit
users to accessing only their data.

This can be done by passing a value in the header of each request to your supergraph; Hasura will then use that value to
return only the data which matches conditions you specify.

:::info Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have:

- A local Hasura DDN project.
- Either JWT or Webhook mode enabled in your [AuthConfig](/reference/metadata-reference/auth-config.mdx).

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Create your ModelPermissions {#step-one}

To create a new role, such as `user`, simply add the role to the list of `permissions` for the model to which you wish
to limit access. Then, set up your access control rules.

In the example below, we'll allow users with the role of `user` to access only their own rows from a `Users` model by
checking for a header value matching their `id`:

```yaml title="For example, in a Users.hml"
---
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Users
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
        #highlight-start
    - role: user
      select:
        filter:
          fieldComparison:
            field: id
            operator: _eq
            value:
              sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
        #highlight-end
```

You can modify this to meet your own data modeling by ensuring that the `field` is a column or type that can be compared
to the value of the session variable you send in the header of your request. In this example, we're using
`x-hasura-user-id`, but you can use any `x-hasura-` value you wish.

### Step 2. Create your TypePermissions

By adding ModelPermissions, we've made the model available to the new role. However, this role is not yet able to access
any of the fields from the model. We can do that by adding the new role to the list of `permissions` and including which
fields are accessible to it.

```yaml title="For example, in a Users.hml"
---
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: Users
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - createdAt
          - email
          - favoriteArtist
          - id
          - isEmailVerified
          - lastSeen
          - name
          - password
          - updatedAt
    #highlight-start
    - role: user
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - createdAt
          - email
          - favoriteArtist
          - id
          - isEmailVerified
          - lastSeen
          - name
          - password
          - updatedAt
    #highlight-end
```

If you want to restrict which fields the new role can access, simply omit them from the list of `allowedFields`.

### Step 3. Test your permissions

Create a new build of your supergraph:

```sh
ddn supergraph build local
```

Then, in a request, pass a header with the [session variable](#step-one) you identified earlier according to your
authentication configuration. You should see a schema limited to whatever ModelPermissions you defined for your new role
and — when executing a query — only see data meeting the filtering rule you included in the first step.

## Wrapping up

In this guide, you learned how to limit a user to see only their own data from a single type. However, you can use this
same tutorial and apply it to a variety of scenarios.

As you continue building out your supergraph, keep in mind that authentication and authorization are crucial components.
Always validate your configuration and regularly test your setup to ensure it functions as expected across different
roles and environments.
