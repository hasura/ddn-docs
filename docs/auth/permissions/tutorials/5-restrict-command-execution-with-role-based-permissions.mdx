# Restrict Command Execution with Role-based Permissions

## Introduction

Often, you'll want to limit a user's ability to execute certain [commands](/data-modeling/command.mdx) — which power
mutations in your GraphQL API — based on some related data. In the example below, we'll build on the
[tutorial found in our PostgreSQL getting-started section](/how-to-build-with-ddn/with-postgresql.mdx) and **restrict
users to only being able to update posts of which they're the author**.

:::info Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have:

- A local Hasura DDN project.
- Either JWT or Webhook mode enabled in your [AuthConfig](/reference/metadata-reference/auth-config.mdx).

## Tutorial

## Step 1. Add an `author` role to your CommandPermissions object

```yaml title="Locate your UpdatePostsById.hml file and update it to the following:" {9-23}
---
kind: CommandPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  commandName: UpdatePostsById
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      allowExecution: true
    - role: author
      allowExecution: true
      argumentPresets:
        - argument: preCheck
          value:
            booleanExpression:
              relationship:
                # Here, `user` refers to the pre-generated relationship's name
                name: user
                predicate:
                  fieldComparison:
                    field: id
                    operator: _eq
                    value:
                      sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
```

This role grants the `author` role permission to execute the `UpdatePostsById` command, but only if the user who
authored the post has an `id` that matches the `x-hasura-user-id` session variable in the request header. This ensures
users can only update posts they have authored.

## Step 2. Add TypePermissions to your response type

The new `author` role will need access to return types for the `UpdatePostsByIdResponse` type.

```yaml title="Find the UpdatePostsByIdResponse TypePermissions object and add the following:" {11-14}
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: UpdatePostsByIdResponse
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - affectedRows
          - returning
    - role: author
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - affectedRows
```

In the configuration above, we're only allowing a user with the role of `author` to access the number of affected rows.
Alternatively, you could include `returning` in the `output` array and _then_ set ModelPermissions **and**
TypePermissions for the `author` role on the `Posts` type to allow for any or specific fields to be returned.

## Step 3. Create a new build and test {#build-and-test}

```yaml title="To test this, if you don't have JWT or Webhook mode enabled, we recommend replacing your AuthConfig with:"
kind: AuthConfig
version: v4
definition:
  mode:
    noAuth:
      role: author
      sessionVariables: { "x-hasura-user-id": 1 }
```

This will set your `x-hasura-role` session variable as `author` and the `x-hasura-user-id` as `1`, enabling you to
impersonate Alice.

```bash title="Create a new build and start your services:"
ddn supergraph build local && ddn run docker-start
```

```graphql title="Then, run the following query:"
mutation UPDATE_POST_TITLE {
  updatePostsById(keyId: "1", updateColumns: { title: { set: "This is not Alice's first post" } }) {
    affectedRows
  }
}
```

```json title="As Alice is the owner of the post with the ID of 1, you should then see the following response:"
{
  "data": {
    "updatePostsById": {
      "affectedRows": 1
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql title="Alternatively, if we run the following — which is on a post Alice does not own — we'll see a different return value:"
mutation UPDATE_POST_TITLE {
  updatePostsById(keyId: "4", updateColumns: { title: { set: "Malicious Actions in the API" } }) {
    affectedRows
  }
}
```

```json title="Being 0, which is the number of rows affected:"
{
  "data": {
    "updatePostsById": {
      "affectedRows": 0
    }
  }
}
```

## Wrapping up

In this tutorial, we've demonstrated the minimum sets of permissions necessary to enforce role-based execution of
commands. While the example illustrates limiting users to updating their own posts, the principles can be applied to any
scenario by which you want to limit command execution — and mutations — based on relationships.
