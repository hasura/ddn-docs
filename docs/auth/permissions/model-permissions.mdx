# Model Permissions

By default, whenever a new model is created in your supergraph, all records are only accessible to the `admin` role. You
can think of these as permissions on rows in a database table.

You can restrict access to certain rows by adding a new item to the `permissions` array in the `ModelPermissions`
object. Each item in the array should have a `role` field and a `select` field. The `select` field should contain a
`filter` expression that determines which rows are accessible to the role when selecting from the model.

Most commonly, you'll use session variables — provided via your configured
[authentication mechanism](/auth/authentication/index.mdx) — to restrict access to rows based on the user's identity or
other criteria. You can also use argument presets to enforce row-level security. You can see an example of this below.

To make a new ModelPermission or role available in your supergraph, after updating your metadata, you'll need to
[create a new build](/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_local.mdx) using the CLI.

      select:
        filter:
          fieldComparison:
            field: author_id
            operator: _eq
            value:
              sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
