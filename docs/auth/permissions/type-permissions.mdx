# Type Permissions

By default, whenever a new type is created in your supergraph, each field is defined as being only accessible to the
`admin` role.

To generate a new role, add a new item to the `permissions` array in the TypePermissions object.

Each item in the array should have a `role` field and an `output` field. The `output` field should contain an
`allowedFields` array, which lists the fields that are accessible to the role when the type is used in an output
context.

To make a new `TypePermission` object or role available in your supergraph, you'll need to
[create a new build](/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_local.mdx) using the CLI.

### Examples

```yaml

kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: article
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - article_id
          - author_id
          - title
    - role: user
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - article_id
          - author_id
```
