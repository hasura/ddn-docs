# Permissions

Access control rules, authorization or "permissions" are essential for securing your data and ensuring that only
authorized users can access it.

Permissions allow you to declaratively define fine-grained rules in metadata which can determine exactly what data each
user can access.

The following types of permissions can be defined:

- To define which **fields** are accessible by a role in the API, configure the appropriate
  [`TypePermissions`](/auth/permissions/type-permissions.mdx)
- To define what **data** within a model are allowed to be accessed by a role, configure the appropriate
  [`ModelPermissions`](/auth/permissions/model-permissions.mdx)
- To define whether the command is **executable** by a role, configure the appropriate
  [`CommandPermissions`](/auth/permissions/command-permissions.mdx)
