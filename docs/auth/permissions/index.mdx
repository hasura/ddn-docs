# Permissions

Access control rules or "permissions" are essential for securing your data and ensuring that only authorized users can
access it.

Permissions allow you to declaratively define fine-grained rules in metadata which can determine exactly what data each
user can access.

The following types of permissions can be defined:

- `TypePermissions`: Define which fields are allowed to be accessed by a role on an output type.
- `ModelPermissions`: Define which objects or rows within a model are allowed to be accessed by a role.
- `CommandPermissions`: Define whether the command is executable by a role.
