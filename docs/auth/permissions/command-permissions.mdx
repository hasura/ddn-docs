# Command Permissions

To limit what **commands** are available to a role in your supergraph, you define a `CommandPermissions` object.

By default, whenever a new command is created in your supergraph, it is only executable by the `admin` role.

You can enable or restrict access to commands by adding a new item to the `permissions` array in the
`CommandPermissions` object. Each item in the array should have a `role` field and an `allowExecution` field. The
`allowExecution` field should be set to `true` if the command is executable by the role.

You can also use argument presets to pass actual logical expressions to your data sources to control how they do things.

For example, a data connector might expose a `Command` called `delete_user_by_id` with two arguments - `user_id` and
`pre_check`. `user_id` is the primary key of the user you'd like to remove, and `pre_check` lets you provide a custom
boolean expression.

```yaml
kind: CommandPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  commandName: delete_user_by_id
  # highlight-start
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      allowExecution: true
    - role: user
      allowExecution: true
      argumentPresets:
        - argument: pre_check
          value:
            booleanExpression:
              fieldComparison:
                field: is_invincible
                operator: _eq
                value:
                  literal: false
  # highlight-end
```

Now, when `admin` role runs this command, once again, they can do what they want, and provide their own `pre_check` if
they want.

The `user` role however, is able to pass a `user_id` argument, but the `pre_check` expression is passed to the data
connector which will only let them delete the row if the row's `is_invincible` value is set to `false`.

To make a execution of a command available to a role in your supergraph, after updating your metadata, you'll need to
[create a new build](/reference/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_local.mdx) using the CLI.

### Examples

```yaml title="Allow admin to execute the get_article_by_id command, restrict user to execute the get_article_by_id command with an id argument preset of 100."
---
kind: CommandPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  commandName: get_article_by_id
  # highlight-start
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      allowExecution: true
    - role: user
      allowExecution: true
      argumentPresets:
        - argument: id
          value:
            literal: 100
  # highlight-end
```
