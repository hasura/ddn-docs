# Multiple Authentication Modes

## Introduction

Hasura DDN supports configuring multiple authentication modes simultaneously, allowing you to use different
authentication methods for different scenarios or clients. This feature enables you to have both JWT and webhook
authentication enabled, or multiple configurations of the same authentication type with different settings.

:::info AuthConfig v4

Multiple authentication modes are available in `AuthConfig` **v4** and above.

:::

## How It Works

When multiple authentication modes are configured:

1. The primary mode specified in the `mode` field of the `AuthConfig` is used by default
2. Alternative modes can be accessed by passing the `X-Hasura-Auth-Mode` header with the identifier of the desired
   authentication mode
3. Each alternative mode has its own complete authentication configuration

The default mode is used when:

- The `X-Hasura-Auth-Mode` header is not provided
- The provided `X-Hasura-Auth-Mode` header does not match any of the alternative mode identifiers

## Configuring Multiple Auth Modes

To configure multiple authentication modes, you need to use `AuthConfig` v4, which introduces the `alternativeModes`
field.

### Example Configuration

Here's an example of an `AuthConfig` with multiple authentication modes:

```yaml
kind: AuthConfig
version: v4
definition:
  mode:
    jwt:
      key:
        fixed:
          algorithm: HS256
          key:
            valueFromEnv: JWT_KEY
      tokenLocation:
        type: BearerAuthorization
      claimsConfig:
        namespace:
          claimsFormat: Json
          location: "/https:~1~1hasura.io~1jwt~1claims"
  alternativeModes:
    - identifier: "user2"
      config:
        webhook:
          url:
            valueFromEnv: USER2_URL
          method: "POST"
    - identifier: "webhook"
      config:
        webhook:
          url:
            value: "https://my-auth-service.example.com/validate"
          method: "POST"
    - identifier: "jwt"
      config:
        jwt:
          key:
            jwkFromUrl: "https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com"
          audience: ["my-firebase-app"]
          issuer: "https://securetoken.google.com/my-firebase-app"
          claimsConfig:
            namespace:
              claimsFormat: Json
              location: "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims"
          tokenLocation: 
            type: Header
            name: "Authorization"
```

In this example:

- The default authentication mode is `jwt` with a fixed key
- Three alternative modes are configured:
  - `user2`: A webhook authentication configuration for a different user
  - `webhook`: A webhook authentication configuration
  - `jwt`: A JWT authentication configuration for Firebase

## Using Multiple Auth Modes

To use a specific authentication mode when making a request to your Hasura DDN API, include the `X-Hasura-Auth-Mode`
header with the identifier of the desired mode.

### Example Requests

Default mode (JWT with fixed key):

```bash
curl https://your-hasura-endpoint.hasura-ddn.com/v1/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-fixed-key-jwt-token" \
  -d '{"query": "{ users { id name } }"}'
```

Using the webhook mode:

```bash
curl https://your-hasura-endpoint.hasura-ddn.com/v1/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Hasura-Auth-Mode: webhook" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-auth-token" \
  -d '{"query": "{ users { id name } }"}'
```

Using the JWT mode:

```bash
curl https://your-hasura-endpoint.hasura-ddn.com/v1/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Hasura-Auth-Mode: jwt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
  -d '{"query": "{ users { id name } }"}'
```

## Use Cases

Multiple authentication modes can be useful in various scenarios:

1. **Development and Testing**: Use fixed key JWT for development and webhook for testing, and switch to production
   custom claims JWT mode when ready
2. **Multiple Client Types**: Support different authentication methods for different client applications
3. **Migration**: Gradually migrate from one authentication provider to another (or from one permission model to
   another)
4. **Admin Access**: Provide a separate authentication mode for administrative access

## Security Considerations

When using multiple authentication modes:

- Set up role-based permissions for each authentication mode to control data access appropriately
- Keep in mind that the `X-Hasura-Auth-Mode` header may be included in standard HTTP request monitoring tools, just like
  other headers
- Consider using network controls (like IP allowlists) or the [Allowlist Plugin](/plugins/allowlist/index.mdx) to manage
  which clients can use specific authentication modes
