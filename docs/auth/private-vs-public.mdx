# Private vs Public

You can choose to make your Hasura DDN API public or private.

## Private

A `private` Hasura DDN API is only accessible to collaborators on your project.

Queries to a private Hasura DDN API must include a special reserved header `x-hasura-ddn-token` with a valid JWT token
which the Hasura console generates and regenerates every hour.

If a `private` API is also set to JWT or Webhook mode, rather than `noAuth` mode, queries must **also** include the JWT
or webhook authentication values to be successful in addition to the `x-hasura-ddn-token` header.

## Public

A public Hasura DDN API is accessible to everyone.

If a `public` API is also set to JWT or Webhook mode, rather than `noAuth` mode, queries must include the JWT or webhook
authentication values to be successful.

Queries to a public Hasura DDN API do not require the `x-hasura-ddn-token` header.

:::danger Public APIs with noAuth mode

If set to `public` with `noAuth` mode, queries do not require any authentication and the API is fully public.

:::

## Changing the API mode

### DDN client

Set to `private` mode:

```bash
ddn project set-api-access-mode private
```

Set to `public` mode:

```bash
ddn project set-api-access-mode public
```

### Hasura console

Click on the `Settings` gear icon in the bottom left of the sidebar navigation and then the `Summary` tab to access the
API access mode toggle at `https://console.hasura.io/project/<your-project-id>/settings/project-summary`.
