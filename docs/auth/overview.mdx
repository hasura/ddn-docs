# Auth

## Introduction

Hasura gives you the power to authenticate users how you want, integrating with many popular auth services or your own
custom solution hosted elsewhere.

Using session variables passed via JWT or webhook from your authentication service you can create granular access
control rules to determine exactly what data your users can access.
