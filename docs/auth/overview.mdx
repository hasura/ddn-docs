# Auth

## Introduction

Hasura is agnostic about how you authenticate users. You can integrate many popular auth services or use your own custom
solution.

After authentication, session variables are passed via either a valid JWT or webhook to the engine to be checked against
your access control rules or "permissions" to determine what data the user can access.

## Private vs Public

You can choose to make your Hasura DDN API public or private. [Read more](/auth/private-vs-public.mdx).

## AuthConfig options

Authentication in Hasura DDN can be set up in one of three modes or multiple modes. These modes and their configuration
options are specified in the `AuthConfig` object within your metadata.

You can configure a single authentication mode or multiple authentication modes using the `alternativeModes` field in
AuthConfig v4. When using multiple authentication modes, you can specify which mode to use for a particular request by
including the `X-Hasura-Auth-Mode` header with the identifier of the desired authentication mode. [Read more about
multiple auth modes](/auth/multiple-auth-modes.mdx).

### JWT mode

Your authentication service must issue JWTs which contain session variables that are passed to the Hasura Engine by the
client on each request. [Read more](/auth/jwt/index.mdx).

### Webhook mode

Hasura Engine will call a webhook on each request with the client headers forwarded. On successful authentication, the
webhook must return a valid `http` response with session variables in the body. [Read more](/auth/webhook/index.mdx).

### NoAuth mode

No authentication is required for a specific role to access the data. [Read more](/auth/noauth-mode.mdx).
