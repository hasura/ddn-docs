# Auth

## Introduction

Hasura allows you to authenticate users how you want, integrating with many popular auth services or your own custom
solution hosted elsewhere.

Using session variables passed via JWT or webhook from your authentication service you can create granular access
control rules to determine exactly what data your users can access.

## AuthConfig options

Authentication in Hasura DDN can be setup in one of three modes:

- JWT
- Webhook
- NoAuth

These options are defined in the `AuthConfig` object in your metadata.

### JWT

Your authentication service must issue JWTs which contain session variables which are passed to the Hasura Engine by the
client on each request.

### Webhook

Hasura Engine will call a webhook on each request which with the client headers. The webhook must return a valid `http`
response with session variables.

### NoAuth

No authentication is required for a specific role.
