# Auth

## Introduction

Hasura allows you to authenticate users how you want, integrating with many popular auth services or your own custom
solution.

After authentication, session variables are passed via valid JWT or webhook from your authentication service to the
engine to be checked against your access control rules or "permissions".

## AuthConfig options

Authentication in Hasura DDN can be setup in one of three modes:

- JWT
- Webhook
- NoAuth

These options are defined in the `AuthConfig` object in your metadata.

### JWT mode

Your authentication service must issue JWTs which contain session variables which are passed to the Hasura Engine by the
client on each request.

### Webhook mode

Hasura Engine will call a webhook on each request which with client headers forwarded. On successful authentication, the
webhook must return a valid `http` response with session variables.

### NoAuth mode

No authentication is required for a specific role.

## Session variables

Session variables passed via JWT or webhook can contain any information you want but must at least contain an
`x-hasura-default-role` property and `x-hasura-allowed-roles` array.

Only keys prefixed with `x-hasura-` will be accessible by the engine.

An `x-hasura-role` value can optionally be sent as a plain header in the request to indicate the role which should be
used. If this is not provided, the engine will use the `x-hasura-default-role` value.
