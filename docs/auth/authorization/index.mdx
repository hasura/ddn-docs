# Hasura Authorization

## Introduction

**Authorization determines what a verified user can access.**

You can define permissions (also known as access control or authorization rules) on
[output types](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx), [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx), and
[commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) in your data domain.

There are three forms of permissions:

- [**Type Permissions**](#type-permissions): Define which fields within a `ScalarType` or `ObjectType` can be accessed
  by a particular role.
- [**Model Permissions**](#model-permissions): Define which rows within a [model](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) can
  be accessed by a specific role.
- [**Command Permissions**](#command-permissions): Define which [commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) can be
  executed by a given role.

A role comes into existence when it is defined in one of these three ways.

Every request to Hasura should carry the necessary session variables or roles from your authentication service. The
presence and values of these roles determine which permissions apply to the request. There is no longer the concept of a
built-in, default, super-user `admin` role in Hasura DDN. You can however set up
[role emulation](/auth/authentication/role-emulation.mdx) in order to test your permissions with another role.

Hasura's roles and permissions are implemented at the Hasura Engine layer. They have no direct relationship to any data
source users and roles.

## Type Permissions {#type-permissions}

You can specify which fields of a `ScalarType` or `ObjectType` are accessible to specific roles.

### Example

To define permissions on an output type `product` for `admin` and `customer` roles:

```yaml
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: product
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - id
          - name
          - price
          - manufacturer_id
    - role: customer
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - id
          - name
          - price
```

:::info No access for undefined roles

If a role doesn't have any permissions defined for a type, it won't have access to it.

:::

## Model Permissions {#model-permissions}

You can control which rows or objects within a model a role can access. The syntax for this filter check, known as a
`FieldComparison` `ModelPredicate`, is available when
[modeling your supergraph](/supergraph-modeling/common-syntax.mdx#modelpredicate).

### Example

The following defines permissions for the `Users` model:

```yaml
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Users
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter:
    - role: customer
      select:
      filter:
        fieldComparison:
          field: id
          operator: _eq
          value:
            sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
```

In the above example, the `admin` role has no restrictions on the `Users` model. The `customer` role can only access the
row where the `id` field matches the `x-hasura-user-id` session variable ie: themselves.

## Command Permissions

Command permissions determine which roles can execute specific commands by defining one boolean value of
`allowExecution` for each role.

### Example

For a command named `send_abandoned_cart_email`, the permissions might look like:

```yaml
kind: CommandPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  commandName: send_abandoned_cart_email
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      allowExecution: true
    - role: customer
      allowExecution: false
```

In the above example the `admin` role can execute the `send_abandoned_cart_email` command, but the `customer` role
cannot.

:::info No access for undefined roles

If a role doesn't have any permissions defined for a command, it won't have the ability to execute that command.

## Testing Permissions

You can test permissions directly in the Hasura Console's API interface:

1. Define the desired permissions for a particular type, model, or command in your metadata.
2. Make a request through the Hasura DDN Console GraphiQL API interface and send the session variables as request
   headers (e.g., a role you've defined permissions for).
3. Check the returned data to ensure it adheres to your permission configurations.
