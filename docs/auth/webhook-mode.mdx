# Webhook Mode

## Introduction

This process of using webhook mode for authentication with Hasura requires specifying a URL - which Hasura calls with
the original request headers - that then returns a body containing the user information in session variables.

The webhook service will use your request headers to determine the auth status of the user and return the user role and
any other information as session variables in the response body.

# Enabling Webhook Authentication

## Introduction

You can enable your Hasura DDN instance to use an auth webhook in just a few steps.

## Step 1. Shaping the webhook request and response

### Request

Your webhook should accept either a GET or POST request. Below is an example of the request headers your webhook might
process:

```json title="Example headers present in a POST request to your webhook endpoint"
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer some-token",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
}
```

When a request is sent to Hasura, these headers will be forwarded to your webhook.

### Parsing

Your webhook is then responsible for parsing, validating, and using the token passed in the header. It will need to:

- **Extract the Token:** Retrieve the Authorization header from the incoming request and extract the token.

- **Validate the Token:** Use a library or your own logic to validate the token. This involves verifying the token's
  signature and decoding its payload to extract user information.

### Response

Based on the validation result, the webhook will need to respond with either a `200` status code (for a valid token) or
a `401` status code (for an invalid or missing token).

To allow the GraphQL request to go through, your webhook must return a `200` status code. You should respond with
session variables beginning with `X-Hasura-*` in the body of your response. The value of each session variable can be
any JSON value. These will be available to your [permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx) in Hasura.

You will, at least, need to set the `X-Hasura-Role` session variable to let the Hasura DDN know which role to use for
this request. Unlike [JWT auth mode](auth/authentication/jwt/index.mdx), you do not have to pass
`X-Hasura-Allowed-Roles` or `X-Hasura-Default-Role` session variables. This is because the webhook is called for each
request, allowing the auth service to easily switch the user role if needed.

In the example below the `X-Hasura-Is-Owner` and `X-Hasura-Custom` are examples of custom session variables which can be
used to enforce permissions in your supergraph.

```json title="Example response from your webhook to Hasura DDN"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "X-Hasura-User-Id": 25,
    "X-Hasura-Role": "user",
    "X-Hasura-Is-Owner": "true",
    "X-Hasura-Custom": "custom value"
}
```

## Step 2. Update your AuthConfig

Hasura utilizes an [AuthConfig](/supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx) object that allows you to define the configuration
for your authentication service. The `auth-config.hml` file can be found in your `globals` directory.

You can use
[Hasura's VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura#:~:text=Hasura%20Language%20Server%20Extension%20for,%2C%20syntax%20highlighting%2C%20and%20more)
to scaffold out your `AuthConfig` object by typing `AuthConfig` and selecting this object from the list of available
options. As you navigate through the skeleton, you can type `CTRL+SPACEBAR` at any point to reveal options for the
different key-value pairs.

In the example below, we're demonstrating a sample authentication webhook.

```yaml title="globals/metadata/auth-config.hml"
kind: AuthConfig
version: v2
definition:
  mode:
    webhook:
      url: http://auth_hook:3050/validate-request
      method: Post
```

:::info Other configuration options are available

What we've provided above is a sample configuration. However, there are many options available, which you can learn
about [here](/supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx#authconfig-authhookconfig).

:::

## Step 3. Rebuild your supergraph

Once you've updated your `auth-config.hml`, you can rebuild your supergraph and test it locally.

```bash title="For example, from the root of your project, run:"
ddn supergraph build local \
  --supergraph supergraph.yaml \
  --env-file .env
```

## Step 4. Make an authenticated request

In the example above, we're using the `BearerAuthorization` method. As such, as we can make a request to our Hasura DDN
instance by including a header with the key-value of `Authorization: Bearer <our-encoded-token>`. For testing, you can
pass this value in the Hasura DDN console's header section.

:::tip Authentication is only part of the puzzle!

Hasura DDN empowers you to easily write your access-control rules, commonly known as authorization, using declarative
metadata. You can use the values passed in your response to then limit which
[models](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#modelpermissions-modelpermissions) and
[types](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#typepermissions-typepermissions) a user has access to with each request.
