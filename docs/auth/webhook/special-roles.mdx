# Enabling Admin and Unauthenticated Requests

Each Hasura DDN project ships with an `admin` role by default which has access to all Models and Types in your
supergraph. On the other hand, there's no concept for unauthenticated access to a supergraph. Below, we'll show you how
to achieve both when using webhooks and Hasura DDN.

## Making admin-level requests

To make an admin-level request, after
[updating up your AuthConfig](/auth/webhook/webhook-mode.mdx#step-2-update-your-authconfig), shape your webhook's
response as follows:

```json title="Example response from your webhook to Hasura DDN"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "X-Hasura-Role": "admin",
}
```

Any request that triggers this response from your webhook will be treated as an `admin` request.

:::info Your JWT claims should be unique for each role

When designing or implementing an auth server, it is crucial to generate JWTs with different claims for each user role
so that each token enables the appropriate data access permissions for that user.

## Making unauthenticated requests

To make an unauthenticated request (i.e., one that is publicly accessible without any authentication), you'll need to do
a few things.

### Step 1. Create the claims

In your authentication server, you can provide a response that identifies the user's role as `public`. This can be any
name you wish, so long as it's not a role (such as `admin`) that already exists.

```json title="Example response from your webhook to Hasura DDN"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "X-Hasura-Role": "public",
}
```

### Step 2. Update ModelPermissions

For whatever [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) you'd like to publicly expose, add a
[`ModelPermissions`](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#modelpermissions-modelpermissions) rule for the public role.

```yaml title="Example ModelPermission for an Events Model"
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Events
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
    #highlight-start
    - role: public
      select:
        filter: null
    #highlight-end
```

### Step 3. Update TypePermissions

Then, determine which [types](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx) you'd like to publicly expose by updating
[TypePermissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#typepermissions-typepermissions). Hasura DDN gives you the
ability to granularly determine which fields from each Model are available to each role.

```yaml title="Example TypePermissions for an Events Model"
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: Events
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - id
          - owner_id
          - created_at
          - updated_at
          - is_live
          - title
          - date
          - description
    #highlight-start
    - role: public
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - id
          - is_live
          - title
          - date
          - description
    #highlight-end
```

### Step 4. Rebuild your supergraph

Once you've updated your metadata files, you can rebuild your supergraph and test it locally.

```bash title="For example, from the root of your project, run:"
ddn supergraph build local \
  --supergraph supergraph.yaml \
  --env-file .env
```

### Step 5. Make an unauthenticated request

In [basic examples](auth/webhook/webhook-mode.mdx#step-2-update-your-authconfig), we're using the `BearerAuthorization`
method. As such, as we can make a request to our Hasura DDN instance by including a header with the key-value of
`Authorization: Bearer <our-encoded-token-with-the-public-claims>`. For testing, you can pass this value in the Hasura
DDN console's header section.
