Welcome to the Architecture documentation page for Hasura V3! Here, we will provide you with an overview of the
architecture of our product.

Hasura V3 has been meticulously designed to cater to the evolving needs of developers in a rapidly changing landscape.
Our architecture revolves around three main pillars, each serving a specific purpose to ensure a seamless and efficient
experience for our users.

The first pillar of our architecture is the API authoring end. We have fundamentally revised and concretized the GraphQL
Data specification, now known as the Open Data Domain Specification. This specification dictates the metadata structure
that the Hasura runtime engine accepts. With this new specification in place, we have introduced a range of tooling to
assist API Developers. From text editor plugins to a robust CLI and a fully refactored console, these tools empower
developers to author metadata in accordance with the new structure.

The second pillar of our architecture focuses on authentication and authorization (AuthN/AuthZ). We understand the
importance of data privacy and control, and thus provide robust mechanisms for managing authentication and
authorization. By implementing industry-standard practices and protocols, we ensure that developers can strike the right
balance between granting autonomy and maintaining necessary controls.

The third pillar of our architecture addresses the critical aspects of performance, security, and reliability. We have
engineered Hasura V3 to deliver unparalleled performance at any scale. Our architecture is optimized to handle high
loads, ensuring that end users have a seamless experience. We also prioritize security, implementing stringent measures
to safeguard data and protect against potential threats. Reliability is another key focus, as we understand the
importance of maintaining service availability and minimizing downtime.

Throughout this documentation, you will find detailed information on each aspect of our architecture, including the API
authoring process, authentication and authorization mechanisms, as well as performance, security, and reliability
considerations. We aim to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how Hasura V3 functions and how it can
empower you in your development journey.

If you have any specific questions or require further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to assist
you!
