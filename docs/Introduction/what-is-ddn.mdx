# What is a Data Delivery Network

The Hasura DDN is a globally distributed and always-available network of API and data connectivity servers. Its purpose
is to enable blazing-fast and secure delivery of real-time data over GraphQL or REST APIs.

The Hasura DDN automates the heavy lifting involved in building and maintaining production-grade APIs. With the DDN, you
can build an API on a data source of your choice and leverage federated remote joins in just a matter of minutes. The
DDN ensures that data is delivered to your clients on the edge, providing low-latency and high-performance access.

At Hasura, we are committed to making APIs accessible to everyone and removing the burden of API infrastructure
management. By entrusting us with maintaining your Service Level Agreements (SLAs), you can focus on your business logic
and the things that truly matter to your project's success.

The Hasura DDN is built on open-source innovations that serve as the major building blocks of its architecture. These
include:

- Hasura Version 3 (V3): Hasura V3 introduces a built-in serverless runtime leveraging the power of Rust. This ensures
enhanced performance and reliability for your APIs.

- OpenDD Specification: The OpenDD Specification provides a standardized approach to API design and data modeling. It
enables you to create APIs that adhere to industry best practices and promote interoperability.

- Native Data Specification: The Native Data Specification is designed to facilitate the development, scaling, and
management of connectors. It empowers you to seamlessly integrate with various data sources and unlock major enterprise
cloud opportunities.

The Hasura DDN brings forth a range of features that can benefit your projects, including:

1. Multi-Region Deployment: Deploy your APIs across multiple regions to ensure global availability and redundancy.

1. Edge Caching: Leverage edge caching capabilities to optimize the performance of your APIs and reduce latency.

1. Zero Downtime Deployment: Seamlessly deploy updates and changes to your APIs without causing any disruptions to your
end users.

1. Model-Based Pricing: Benefit from a pricing model that aligns with your usage and provides flexibility as your
project scales.

1. Fast Iteration on Metadata: Enjoy the ability to iterate rapidly on your metadata, enabling quick adjustments and
enhancements to your APIs.

1. Local Development: Develop and test your APIs locally, ensuring a smooth development experience before deploying to
production.
