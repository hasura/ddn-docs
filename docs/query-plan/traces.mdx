# Traces

## Introduction

[Distributed traces](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/) track and map journeys of user requests
across various services or components.

Traces are typically used to diagnose or debug which part of your application could potentially be responsible for a
failure or error state and to monitor the performance of end-user interactions with your application.

Traces are generated by instrumenting application code. Hasura DDN instruments all API queries with the OpenTelemetry
format and supports tracing out of the box. **This means that you don't have to set up your own OpenTelemetry
collector.** Simply head to the `Query Tracing` tab from `Settings` for a project's Console, and you'll see traces for
all your API requests.

## Spans

Every request to your GraphQL API will have a unique `trace-id` associated with it and may have the following spans:

- `/graphql`
  - `handle_authentication`
    - `execute_authentication`
  - `handle_request`
    - `execute_query`
      - `execute`
        - `execute_ndc_query`
          - `Execute Query`
        - `execute_ndc_mutation`

| Span name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/graphql`               | The root span for every request to your GraphQL API.                                                                                                                                        |
| `handle_authentication`  | The span responsible for handling authentication before the request is executed by the engine.                                                                                              |
| `execute_authentication` | The span responsible for executing authentication, either using JWTs or via a Webhook.                                                                                                      |
| `handle_request`         | The span responsible for handling a GraphQL request after it is successfully authenticated by the engine.                                                                                   |
| `execute_query`          | The top-level span for executing a GraphQL query.                                                                                                                                           |
| `execute`                | The span responsible for executing each query in your GraphQL request. This span has an attribute `usage_counts` which describes all the models that were used as a part of this operation. |
| `execute_ndc_query`      | The span responsible for executing a single ndc query. This span has an attribute `field` which describes the schema type that was executed.                                                |
| `Execute Query`          | The span responsible for executing the generated query on the data source.                                                                                                                  |
| `execute_ndc_mutation`   | The span responsible for executing a single ndc mutation. This span has an attribute `field` which describes the field that was executed.                                                   |

:::info What are spans?

Spans represent the basic unit of work in a distributed system. They describe the operation that an individual component
of the system is doing, such as the time taken to execute a function or a request.
