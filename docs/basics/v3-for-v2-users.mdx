# Hasura DDN for Hasura v2 users

## Introduction

Hasura DDN has been built for scale, both in terms of actual performance, and the size of teams which can easily
collaborate on any given project.

When reviewing the v3 documentation as a Hasura v2 user, especially for PostgreSQL database features, it may seem that
some of the experience and features — such as console-based API authoring, database management UIs, database migrations,
and Event Triggers — that have been important parts of v2 experience are not present.

## Known limitations

We are rapidly adding API features to Haura DDN. To keep up to date, please check out our
[product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/hasura/projects/201).

- **Mutations, Event Triggers and Subscriptions:** Coming soon! Mutations and event triggers can be performed via
  [Commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx). Please check out the commands and Typescript Connector out for
  [business logic](/getting-started/build/06-add-business-logic.mdx) and
  [mutations](/getting-started/build/08-mutate-data.mdx).
- **Compatibility:** Some advanced Hasura v2 features might not be supported, but are on the product roadmap.
- **Migration Tools:** Complete migration tools from Hasura v2 to DDN are in-development.
- **Data Connectors:** Not all previously-supported data sources have connectors yet; however, the SDKs will soon bridge
  this gap. You can see the list of available and soon-to-be-available connectors on the
  [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors).

Check out the [FAQ section](/faq.mdx) for more information on the major changes from v2.

## State of play

If you've been using Hasura v2 for building new greenfield applications, we will make sure that you'll be far more
productive and efficient when using Hasura v3 and DDN compared to Hasura v2 to build and manage APIs.

For our initial release we've focused on making sure that Hasura v3 is set up for being massively more scalable for
working with existing brownfield data and then gradually start to improve the experience for greenfield data.

As an example, the huge effort we've put into the underlying engineering work on DDN is what's allowed us to create a
free-forever-at-any-scale-whatsoever tier for running your GraphQL API.

So in case you as a v2 user are feeling left behind, don't worry, we'll get there over the coming months!
