# Hasura DDN for Hasura v2 PostgreSQL users

## Introduction

Hasura DDN has been completely re-built for scale, both in terms of actual performance, and the size of teams which can
easily collaborate on any given project.

When reviewing the v3 documentation as a Hasura V2 user, especially for PostgreSQL database features, it may seem that
some of the experience and features that have been important parts of v2 experience are not present.

e.g: Console-based API authoring, database management UIs, database migrations, Event Triggers, etc.

Rest assured, we are working hard to achieve feature parity with v2 and beyond.

## Roadmap

Here is the general roadmap for when some v2 features are going to make their way into v3:

### Now

- PostgreSQL databases
- TypeScript Node.js Lambda connector
- Self-hosted
- Local development with Hasura v3 Docker

### Next

- Database admin tool (April 16th)
- Subscriptions
- Event Triggers

### Later

- v2 to v3 migration tool

## State of play

If you've been using Hasura v2 for building new greenfield applications, by mid 2024 we will make sure that you'll
be far more productive and efficient when using Hasura v3 and DDN compared to Hasura v2 to build and manage APIs.

For our initial release we've focused on making sure that Hasura v3 is set up for being massively more scalable for
working with existing brownfield data and then gradually start to improve the experience for greenfield data.

As an example, the huge effort we've put into the underlying engineering work on DDN is what's allowed us to create a
free-forever-at-any-scale-whatsoever tier for running your GraphQL API.

So in case you as a v2 user are feeling left behind, don't worry, we'll get there over the coming months!
