# Background

## Why are we building Hasura DDN?

With the rapid evolution of digital experiences, businesses are constantly seeking solutions to build next-generation
applications efficiently and cost-effectively. However, a common bottleneck is the inability to swiftly provide secure
and efficient access to necessary data.

Hasura DDN addresses this challenge, by utilizing the **[data supergraph](#what-is-a-supergraph)** architecture and
development methodology in a way which unlocks improved team and developer productivity.

### Meeting the growing needs of our developer community

In speaking with developers building APIs and microservices, we realized the community is faced with significant
challenges. Hasura DDN was built to address these problems and simplify the lives of software developers and architects
everywhere. The major challenges we will solve with DDN are:

- Feature-rich domain modeling
- Composability across diverse data domains
- Rapid building, authoring and iteration Experience
- Performance / Operational overhead
- Zero-downtime rollouts and no breaking changes
- Bringing programming language framework of choice
- Edge and distributed topology
- Rapid onboarding and discovery of data domains
- Federated CI/CD across multiple teams
- Data connectivity options and flexibility

### The reduction of traditional microservices & APIs

With Hasura DDN, the need for server or client-side API services is significantly reduced as applications can now query
the Hasura generated API layer directly so that developers can build and ship modern, performant apps and APIs 10x
faster.

### What is a data supergraph? {#what-is-a-supergraph}

At its core, a supergraph allows you to combine multiple sources of data into one unified graph API, allowing disparate
data entities and operations to seamlessly interconnect.

A data supergraph merges the best of two worlds:

- The efficiency of a centralized monolithic approach with its easier governance and cohesion.
- The flexibility and scalability benefits traditionally offered by microservices including ownership management and
  loose coupling.

Today, supergraphs are more critical than ever due to the explosion of data sources and increasing microservice sprawl
leading to slower time-to-market, difficult data interconnection, complex permissioning, ballooning tech-debt, with slow
and complicated team communication.

With supergraphs, teams can combat these issues, leading to better products, faster launches, manageable product
evolution, and seamless team interactions.

The supergraph pattern has been adopted by organizations such as Netflix, Airbnb, Goldman Sachs, and LinkedIn.

## What is the Hasura Data Delivery Network (DDN)?

Hasura DDN is a paradigm shift in data API creation and management and how we think about data domains in response to
the evolved requirements of our users. Based on the new Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD spec) and Native Data
Connector Specifications (NDC spec), Hasura DDN facilitates the rapid declarative scaffolding and deployment of an API
layer that can be configured to connect to virtually any data source. With Hasura DDN, we are introducing a new approach
to microservices development that is designed to provide, both in developer workflow and final product: a faster, more
powerful, agile, and scalable solution for building modern applications.
