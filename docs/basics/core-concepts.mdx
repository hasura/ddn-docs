# Core Concepts

The sprawl of microservices and APIs has led to a new set of challenges for developers and architects.

In the modern era of building applications, the data layer is becoming increasingly complex; it's no longer just a
database, but a collection of databases, services, and APIs. Hasura DDN introduces the concept of a **data supergraph**
to help you manage this complexity.

## The state of the data layer

Imagine the following 30,000-foot view of a data layer for a hypothetical e-commerce application:

- A relational database for storing product information.
- A document database for storing user information.
- A search service for searching products.
- A payment service for processing payments.
- A shipping service for fulfilling orders.
- A vector database for storing user recommendations.

This isn't an uncommon scenario. The problem is that each of these data sources has its own
API, its own schema, and its own way of doing things. This makes it complicated to build applications that span multiple
data sources. It slows down development, takes a room full of architects to design, and requires a team of engineers to
maintain.


## Subgraphs

In our e-commerce application example, each data source represents what we term a **[subgraph](/ci-cd/subgraphs.mdx)**.

However, a subgraph is much more than just a single data source; it is a comprehensive collection encompassing tables, types,
APIs, and schemas that define how data is structured and accessed. While a subgraph functions as an independent entity
with its own unique API, Hasura can seamlessly integrate it with other subgraphs. This integration forms a cohesive and
larger data supergraph.

Each subgraph in our example, whether it is the relational database for product information, the document database for
user data, or the services for search, payment, and shipping, is a modular component of the data supergraph. These
components securely work together to overcome the traditional barriers posed by isolated data sources, facilitating a more fluid
and interconnected data layer. This integrated approach simplifies application development across diverse data systems,
enabling faster iteration and more efficient maintenance by engineering teams.

### How do I build a subgraph?

Subgraphs are connected to your data layer using a **[data connector](/connectors/overview.mdx)**. Hasura DDN ships with
a number of data connectors that work with popular databases, services, and APIs out-of-the-box; you can also build your
own. This saves you the time and effort of building and maintaining your own APIs to manage data sources and existing
microservices.

With each subgraph you add to your Hasura project, you're adding a piece to your connected and secure data layer. You can add as many
subgraphs as you need to represent your data layer. **These subgraphs can even be your own custom business logic as
TypeScript functions that return or mutate data directly via your GraphQL API** which can then be consumed as part of a single, secure GraphQL API: your data supergraph.

## Supergraph

A data supergraph is a the framework that brings together all of your subgraphs into one secure API.  This
orchestration allows for the creation of applications that span multiple data sources, seamlessly bridging their
complexities under one umbrella.

For frontend developers, this means accessing a singular API that simplifies application development, enabling them to
focus on building features rather than navigating the intricacies of each individual data source. For backend
developers, this means a more efficient and streamlined development process, with the ability to build and maintain
subgraphs independently of one another.

This empowers individual teams to build and maintain their own subgraphs without having to worry about how those
subgraphs will be consumed by other teams. This allows you to iterate faster and ship more often.

### How do I build a supergraph?

This happens automatically.

As you add subgraphs to your Hasura project, Hasura DDN automatically builds a supergraph of all your data sources. You
have the freedom and flexibility to define relationships — including fine-grained access control — across this
supergraph, connecting data sources together and making them available in ways that make sense for your application.
