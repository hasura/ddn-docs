      <p>
        Hasura DDN is fundamentally about connecting data sources to the Hasura Engine via Data Connectors and to define
        these connections and relationships using a metadata standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        This architecture is known as a <strong>Data Supergraph</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>With this approach, Hasura DDN has unlocked powerful capabilities and features:</p>
      <ul className={"introList"}>
        <li>A 100% code-first approach.</li>
        <li>Instant generated APIs (of course!)</li>
        <li>Data connectors for any conceivable source of data and the ability to build your own.</li>
        <li>No more data silos: interconnected and joined data from all your sources, business logic, and APIs.</li>
        <li>Declarative security and access control.</li>
        <li>No black boxes: absolutely transparent query plan and execution observability.</li>
        <li>Push-down capabilities and native queries.</li>
        <li>Business logic as a first-class citizen.</li>
        <li>Instant OpenAPI interoperability.</li>
        <li>Sub-second deployments and powerful CI/CD capabilities.</li>
        <li>Unlimited scalability and performance.</li>
        <li>Powerful development, team collaboration and versioning features.</li>
        <li>Data access from the edge and one-line multi-region routing.</li>
        <li>No single point of failure thanks to graph resiliency and fault tolerance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We're excited to show you how we're going to revolutionize your product development experience.</p>
