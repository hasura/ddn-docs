# Known Limitations for Beta

Being the first glimpse into Hasura DDN, the beta release comes with some limitations:

- **Mutations, Event Triggers and Subscriptions:** Coming soon! Mutations can be executed using
  [native queries](/docs/graphql-api/mutations/index.mdx), though.
- **Compatibility:** Some advanced Hasura v2 features might not be supported, but are on the product roadmap.
- **Migration Tools:** Complete migration tools from Hasura v2 to DDN are in development.
- **Data Connectors:** Not all previously-supported data sources have connectors yet; however, the SDKs will soon bridge
  this gap. You can see the list of available and soon-to-be-available connectors on the
  [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors).

Check out the [FAQ section](/faq.mdx) for more information on the major changes from v2.
