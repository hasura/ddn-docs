# Monitor your Supergraph

## Overview

Monitoring API performance and obtaining actionable insights is crucial for maintaining an efficient and responsive
system. However, this process is often hindered by several significant challenges. Developers frequently rely on
disparate tools that are not integrated, making it difficult to gather and analyze performance metrics cohesively. The
delay in obtaining insights due to data aggregation and analysis can slow down decision-making, impacting the overall
performance and reliability of the API.

Furthermore, setting up and maintaining these monitoring tools requires considerable effort and expertise, adding to the
complexity and resource burden. These obstacles highlight the need for a more streamlined approach to performance
monitoring.

Hasura DDN simplifies performance monitoring by providing:

- **Instant Insights:** Access key metrics and traces in real-time on the insights page.
- **Integrated Monitoring:** Monitor performance directly within the console without needing additional tools.
- **Proactive Optimization:** Quickly identify and address performance issues, ensuring a smooth and efficient
  supergraph API experience.

:::info more information

Aside from the information below, you can dig into our observability options [here](/observability/overview.mdx).

You can also use the console to [visualize](/basics/explore/explore-your-api.mdx) and
[interact with](/basics/explore/interact.mdx) your API.

From the sidenav of the console — Hasura's web-based GUI — you can access the `Insights` page.

## Step 1. View performance metrics

You can access key performance metrics for both your project and for each build:

## Step 2. View traces

You can also click the `Traces` tab at the top of the page and get query-by-query trace data for each request, seeing
all the same details as when using the
[`View Trace` button in the GraphiQL explorer](/basics/explore/interact.mdx#traces).
