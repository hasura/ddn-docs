# Hasura DDN for Hasura v2 PostgreSQL users

## Introduction

As Hasura v2 PostgreSQL users, you might be looking at Hasura DDN and Hasura v3 and suddenly feeling that features were
taken away.

- Where did the database creation tab go?
- Why can't I create stuff via the console?
- What happened to database migrations?

## Roadmap

Here is the general roadmap for how some v2 features are going to make their way into v3:

### Now

- [PostgreSQL databases](/connectors/postgresql/)
- [TypeScript Node.js Lambda connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-nodejs-lambda)
- Self-hosted
- Local development with Hasura v3 Docker

### Next

- Database admin tool (April 16th)
- Subscriptions
- Event Triggers

### Later

- v2 to v3 migration tool

## State of play

If you've been using Hasura v2 for building new greenfield applications, by mid 2024 we will make sure that you'll
be far more productive and efficient when using Hasura v3 and DDN compared to Hasura v2 to build and manage APIs.

For our initial release we've focused on making sure that Hasura v3 is set up for being massively more scalable for
working with existing brownfield data and then gradually start to improve the experience for greenfield data.

As an example, the huge effort we've put into the underlying engineering work on DDN is what's allowed us to create a
free-forever-at-any-scale-whatsoever tier for running your GraphQL API.

Incidentally, this is the same approach (prioritizing brownfield PostgreSQL & performance first) we took when we built
Hasura v1 (which became v2), and why Hasura's PostgreSQL support and performance left other GraphQL servers in the dust
regardless of the workload. ðŸ˜Š

So in case you as a v2 user are feeling left behind, don't worry, we'll get there over the coming months!
