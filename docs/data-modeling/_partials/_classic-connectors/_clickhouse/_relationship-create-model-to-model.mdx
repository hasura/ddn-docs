Following on from the [ClickHouse tutorial in the How to Build with DDN](/how-to-build-with-ddn/with-clickhouse.mdx)
section, you can manually create a relationship between two models which have no foreign-key-like relationship defined
in the database which the data connector would be able to detect.

In the tutorial, we created a `posts` to `users` relationship. Let's now add the inverse as a relationship from the
`Users` to `Posts` models.

```yaml title="Open the Users.hml file and add the following to the end:"
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: posts
  sourceType: Users
  target:
    model:
      name: Posts
      relationshipType: Array
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: userId
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: userId
```

Now you can build your supergraph API, serve it, and query your data.

```bash title="Build and run your supergraph API:"
ddn supergraph build local
ddn run docker-start
```

Now you can query your data with your relationship in the console get users and their posts.

```bash title="Query your data:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql
query UsersWithPosts {
  users {
    name
    age
    posts {
      content
      title
      userId
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 25,
        "posts": [
          {
            "content": "This is Alice's first post.",
            "title": "My First Post",
            "userId": 1
          },
          {
            "content": "Alice writes again!",
            "title": "Another Post",
            "userId": 1
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": 30,
        "posts": [
          {
            "content": "Bob shares his thoughts.",
            "title": "Bob's Post",
            "userId": 2
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Charlie",
        "age": 35,
        "posts": [
          {
            "content": "Charlie joins the conversation.",
            "title": "Hello World",
            "userId": 3
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
