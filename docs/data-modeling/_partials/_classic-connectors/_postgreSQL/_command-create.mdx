Since ndc-postgres v1.2.0, mutations are generated automatically. If you are on an earlier version, since v0.8.0, you
can still get autogenerated mutations by adding `"mutationsVersion": "v2"` to your configuration.json. You can read more
about this configuration option and others on the PostgreSQL connector
[configuration docs](/connectors/postgresql/configuration-reference/version-5.mdx).

```bash title="Use the DDN CLI to introspect your MongoDB instance:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```sh title="Then, update your commands:"
ddn command add <connector_name> "*"
```
