First, show a list of resouces identified by the connector.

```bash title="Use the DDN CLI to introspect your PostgreSQL database:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash
ddn connector show-resources my_pg
```

You will see a list of Commands (Mutations) which have been automatically detected by the connector since they are
defined by a foreign key relationship in the database.

```sh title="Then, add your command:"
ddn command add my_pg insert_users
```

Rebuild your supergraph API.

```bash title="Create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

Serve your build.

```bash title="Serve your build:"
ddn run docker-start
ddn console --local
```

Run the mutation:

```graphql
mutation InsertUser {
  insertUsers(objects: { age: "21", name: "Sean" }, postCheck: {}) {
    affectedRows
    returning {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "insertUsers": {
      "affectedRows": 1,
      "returning": [
        {
          "id": 4,
          "name": "Sean",
          "age": 21
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
