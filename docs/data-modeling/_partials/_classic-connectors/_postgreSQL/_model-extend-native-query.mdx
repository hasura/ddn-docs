Within your connector's directory, you can add a new file with a `.sql` extension to define a native query.

```sh title="Create a new directory to store your native queries:"
mkdir -p <my_subgraph>/connector/<connector_name>/native_operations/queries/
```

```sql title="Create a new file in your connector's directory:"
-- native_operations/queries/user_by_name_between.sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE name LIKE '%' || {{name}} || '%'
  AND name > {{lower_bound}}
  AND name < {{upper_bound}}
```

```sh title="Then, use the PostgreSQL connector's plugin to add the native query to your connector's configuration:"
ddn connector plugin \
  --connector my_subgraph/connector/my_connector/connector.yaml \
  -- \
  native-operation create \
  --operation-path native_operations/queries/user_by_name_between.sql \
  --kind query
```

```sh title="Introspect your PostgreSQL instance:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```sh title="Then, update your models:"
ddn model update <connector_link_name> "*"
```
