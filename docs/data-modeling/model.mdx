# Models Read Data

## Introduction

In DDN, Models represent entities or collections that can be queried in your data sources, such as tables, views,
collections, native queries, and more.

## Lifecycle

The lifecycle in creating a model in your metadata is as follows:

1. Have some entity in your data source that you want to make queryable via your API.
2. Introspect your data source using the DDN CLI with the relevant data connector to fetch the entity resources.
3. Add the model to your metadata with the DDN CLI.
4. Create a build of your supergraph API with the DDN CLI.
5. Serve your build as your API with the Hasura engine either locally or in the cloud.
6. Iterate on your API by repeating this process or by editing your metadata manually as needed.

## Create a model

To add a model you will need to have a data connector already set up and connected to the data source. Follow the
relevant tutorial for your data source in [How to Build with DDN](/how-to-build-with-ddn/overview.mdx) to get to that
point.

```bash title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

Whenever you update your data source, you can run the above command to fetch the latest resources.

```bash title="Show the resources discovered from your data source:"
ddn connector show-resources <connector_name>
```

This is an optional step and will output a list of resources that DDN discovered in your data source in the previous
step.

```bash
ddn model add <connector_link_name> <collection_name>
```

Or you can optionally add all the models by specifying `"*"`.

```bash
ddn model add <connector_link_name> "*"
```

This will add models with their accompanying metadata definitions to your metadata.

You can now build your supergraph API, serve it, and query your data.

:::info Context for CLI commands

Note that the above CLI commands work without also adding the relevant subgraph to the command with the `--subgraph`
flag because this has been set in the CLI context. You can learn more about creating and switching contexts in the
[CLI context](/) section. {/* TODO: Add link */}

For a walkthrough on how to create a model, see the [Model Tutorials](#model-tutorials) section.

### Via native query

You can use the query syntax of the underlying data source to create a native query and expose it as a model in your
supergraph API.

The process of adding a native query is more or less unique for each data connector as each data source by nature has
its own syntax.

<Tabs groupId="source-preference" className="api-tabs">
  <TabItem value="PostgreSQL" label="PostgreSQL">

    <ModelCreateNativeQueryHowToPostgreSQL />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="MongoDB" label="MongoDB">

    <ModelCreateNativeQueryHowToMongoDB />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ClickHouse" label="ClickHouse">

    <ModelCreateNativeQueryHowToClickHouse />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Find a tutorial on how to add a native query for your data connector in the relevant section [here](/).

## Update a model

If you want to update your model to reflect a change that happened in the underlying data source you should first
introspect to get the latest resources and then update the relevant model.

```bash title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Then, update your existing model:"
ddn model update <connector_link_name> <model_name>
```

You will see an output which explains how new resources were added or updated in the model.

You can now build your supergraph API, serve it, and query your data with the updated model.

You can also update the model by editing the metadata manually.

For a walkthrough on how to update a model, see the [Model Tutorials](#model-tutorials) section.

## Extend a model

A model can be extended in order to return nested data or to enrich or add to the data.

For example you can extend a model like `Customers` to also return the related `Orders` for each customer.

Or you can add a custom piece of logic on a model like `Orders` to compute and return the current currency conversion of
the total price of the order.

The way this is done is via a `Relationship`. Read more about
[creating relationships here](/data-modeling/relationship.mdx).

## Delete a model

```bash title="If you no longer need a model, you can delete it:"
ddn model remove users
```

In addition to removing the Model object itself, the DDN CLI will also remove the associated metadata definitions.

## Tutorials {#model-tutorials}

The tutorials below follow on from each particular tutorial in the
[How to Build with DDN](/how-to-build-with-ddn/overview.mdx) section. Select the relevant data connector to follow the
tutorial.

### Creating a model

To query data from your API, you'll first need to create a model that represents that data.

<Tabs groupId="source-preference" className="api-tabs">
  <TabItem value="PostgreSQL" label="PostgreSQL">

    <ModelCreatePostgreSQL />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="MongoDB" label="MongoDB">

    <ModelCreateMongoDB />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ClickHouse" label="ClickHouse">

    <ModelCreateClickHouse />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Updating a model

Your underlying data source may change over time. You can update your model to reflect these changes.

You'll need to update the mapping of your model to the data source by updating the
[DataConnectorLink](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx) object.

```bash title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Then, update your model:"
ddn model update <connector_link_name> <model_name>
```

This will find changed resources in the data source and attempt to merge them into the model.

If you'd like to completely add the model again, you can first run the `model remove` command (below) and then re-create
your model.

### Extending a model {#tutorial-extend-model}

Find tutorials about extending a model with related information or custom logic in the
[Relationships](/data-modeling/relationship.mdx) section.

### Deleting a model

```bash title="If you no longer need a model, you can delete it:"
ddn model remove users
```

## Reference

You can learn more about models in the metadata reference [docs](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx).
