# Models Read Data

## Introduction

In DDN, **Models** represent entities that can be queried in your data sources, such as tables, views, collections,
native operations and more.

## Lifecycle

The lifecycle in creating a model in your metadata is as follows:

1. Have some entity in your data source that you want to make queryable via your API.
2. Introspect your data source using the DDN CLI with the relevant data connector to fetch the entity resources.
3. Add the model to your metadata with the DDN CLI.
4. Create a build of your supergraph API with the DDN CLI.
5. Serve your build as your API with the Hasura engine either locally or in the cloud.
6. Iterate on your API by repeating this process or by editing your metadata manually as needed.

## Create a model

To add a model you will need to have a data connector already setup and connected to the data source. Follow the
[Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) or the tutorial in [How to Build with DDN](/getting-started/overview.mdx) to
get to that point.

```bash title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

Whenever you update your data source, you can run the above command to fetch the latest resources.

```bash title="Show the resources discovered from your data source:"
ddn connector show-resources <connector_name>
```

This is an optional step and will output a list of resources that DDN discovered in your data source in the previous
step.

```bash title="Add the model from the discovered resources to your metadata:"
ddn model add <connector_link_name> <collection_name>
```

Or you can optionally add all the models by specifying `"*"`.

```bash title="Add all models from your data source:"
ddn model add <connector_link_name> "*"
```

This will add models with their accompanying metadata definitions to your metadata.

You can now build your supergraph API, serve it, and query your data.

:::info Context for commands

Note that the above commands work without also adding the relevant subgraph to the command with the `--subgraph` flag
because this has been set in the CLI context. You can learn more about creating and switching contexts in the
[CLI context](/getting-started/overview.mdx) section. {/* TODO: Add link */}

For a walkthrough on how to create a model, see the [Model Tutorials](#model_tutorials) section.

## Update a model

If you want to update your model to reflect a change that happened in the underlying data source you should first
introspect to get the latest resources and then update the relevant model.

```bash title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Then, update your existing model:"
ddn model update <connector_link_name> <model_name>
```

You will see an output which explains how new resources were added or updated in the model.

You can now build your supergraph API, serve it, and query your data with the updated model.

You can also update the model by editing the metadata manually.

For a walkthrough on how to update a model, see the [Model Tutorials](#model_tutorials) section.

## Delete a model

```bash title="If you no longer need a model, you can delete it:"
ddn model remove users
```

In addition to removing the Model object itself, the DDN CLI will also remove the associated metadata definitions.

## Model Tutorials {#model-tutorials}

The tutorials below follow on from each particular tutorial in the
[How to Build with DDN](/getting-started/overview.mdx) section. Select the relevant data connector to follow the
tutorial.

### Creating a model

To query data from your API, you'll first need to create a model that represents that data.

<Tabs groupId="source-preference" className="api-tabs">
  <TabItem value="PostgreSQL" label="PostgreSQL">

    <ModelCreatePostgreSQL />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="MongoDB" label="MongoDB">

    <ModelCreateMongoDB />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ClickHouse" label="ClickHouse">

    <ModelCreateClickHouse />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Updating a model

Your underlying data source may change over time. You can update your model to reflect these changes.

You'll need to update the mapping of your model to the data source by updating the
[DataConnectorLink](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx) object.

```bash title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Then, update your model:"
ddn model update <connector_link_name> <model_name>
```

### Deleting a model

```bash title="If you no longer need a model, you can delete it:"
ddn model remove users
```

## Reference

You can learn more about models in the metadata reference [docs](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx).
