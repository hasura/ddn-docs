# Data Modeling

## Introduction

Hasura DDN defines your API schema declaratively. An approach that centralizes all your data collections, operations,
relationships, and permissions in one place. This makes it easy to organize, modify, secure, reason about, and grow the
schema which represents your API.

## Process

Hasura DDN uses data connectors to connect to your data sources.

Data connectors introspect the source to understand the source schema.

The DDN CLI uses the introspection results to generate the API schema metadata objects. This can also be done manually.

The metadata is then "built" by the DDN CLI into a format which the Hasura GraphQL engine can use to serve your API.

## Metadata Objects

There are [many types of metadata objects](/supergraph-modeling/overview.mdx) which define your API, but the most
important ones which we will cover in this section are:

- [Models](/data-modeling/model.mdx) which read data
- [Commands](/data-modeling/command.mdx) which modify data
- [Relationships](/data-modeling/relationship.mdx) which connect data
- [Permissions](/data-modeling/permissions.mdx) which protect data
