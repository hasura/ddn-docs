# Commands Modify Data

## Introduction

In DDN, Commands represent operations in your API that can be executed such as those which modify data in your data
sources, (inserts, updates, deletes), or custom business logic operations.

## Lifecycle

The lifecycle in creating a command in your metadata is as follows:

1. Have some operation in your data source that you want to make executable via your API.
2. Introspect your data source using the DDN CLI with the relevant data connector to fetch the operation resources.
3. Add the command to your metadata with the DDN CLI.
4. Create a build of your supergraph API with the DDN CLI.
5. Serve your build as your API with the Hasura engine either locally or in the cloud.
6. Iterate on your API by repeating this process or by editing your metadata manually as needed.

## Create a command

To add a command you will need to have a data connector already set up and connected to the data source. Follow the
[Quickstart](/quickstart.mdx) or the tutorial in [How to Build with DDN](/how-to-build-with-ddn/overview.mdx) to get to
that point.

```bash title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Show the resources discovered from your data source:"
ddn connector show-resources <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Add the command from the discovered resources to your metadata:"
ddn command add <connector_link_name> <operation_name>
```

Or you can optionally add all the commands by specifying `"*"`.

```bash title="Add all commands from your data source:"
ddn command add <connector_link_name> "*"
```

This will add commands with their accompanying metadata definitions to your metadata.

You can now build your supergraph API, serve it, and execute your commands.

:::info Context for CLI commands

Note that the above CLI commands work without also adding the relevant subgraph to the command with the `--subgraph`
flag because this has been set in the CLI context. You can learn more about creating and switching contexts in the
[CLI context](/) section. {/* TODO UPDATE LINK */}

:::

For a walkthrough on how to create a command, see the [Command Tutorials](#command-tutorials) section below.

## Update a command

If you want to update your command to reflect a change that happened in the underlying data source you should first
introspect to get the latest resources and then update the relevant command.

```bash title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Then, update your existing command:"
ddn command update <connector_link_name> <command_name>
```

You will see an output which explains how new resources were added or updated in the command.

You can now build your supergraph API, serve it, and execute your commands with the updated definitions.

You can also update the command by editing the command's metadata manually.

## Delete a command

```bash title="If you no longer need a command, you can delete it:"
ddn command remove <command_name>
```

Along with the command itself, the associated metadata is also removed.

## Tutorials {#command-tutorials}

The tutorials below follow on from each particular tutorial in the
[How to Build with DDN](/how-to-build-with-ddn/overview.mdx) section. Select the relevant data connector to follow the
tutorial.

### Creating a command

To modify data, you first need to create a command that maps to a specific operation within your data source.

<Tabs groupId="source-preference" className="api-tabs">
  <TabItem value="PostgreSQL" label="PostgreSQL">
    <CommandCreatePostgreSQL />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="MongoDB" label="MongoDB">
    <CommandCreateMongoDB />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ClickHouse" label="ClickHouse">
    <CommandCreateClickHouse />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="TypeScript" label="Node.js TypeScript">
    <CommandCreateLambdaTypescript />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python">
    <CommandCreateLambdaPython />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Go" label="Go">
    <CommandCreateLambdaGo />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Lambda connectors

Lambda connectors allow you to execute custom business logic directly via your API. You can learn more about Lambda
connectors in the [docs](/business-logic/overview.mdx).

### Updating a command

Your underlying data source may change over time. You can update your command to reflect these changes.

<Tabs groupId="source-preference" className="api-tabs">
  <TabItem value="PostgreSQL" label="PostgreSQL">
    <CommandUpdatePostgreSQL />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="MongoDB" label="MongoDB">
    <CommandUpdateMongoDB />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ClickHouse" label="ClickHouse">
    <CommandUpdateClickHouse />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="TypeScript" label="Node.js TypeScript">
    <CommandUpdateLambdaTypescript />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python">
    <CommandUpdateLambdaPython />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Go" label="Go">
    <CommandUpdateLambdaGo />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Deleting a command

```bash title="If you no longer need a command, you can delete it with the CLI:"
ddn command remove <command_name>
```

## Reference

You can learn more about commands in the metadata reference [docs](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx).
