# Commands Modify Data

## Introduction

Commands enable you to perform actions that modify data — such a perform updates or inserts — in your data source.
Commands also allow you to execute custom business logic directly via your API.

## Lifecycle

:::info New to Hasura DDN?

If you haven't already, have a run through our [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx) guide to set up your Hasura
DDN instance. In the sections below, we'll guide you through how to interact with your metadata and shape your API to
your liking!

:::

### Creating a command

To modify data, you first need to create a command that maps to a specific operation within your data source.

<Tabs groupId="source-preference" className="api-tabs">
  <TabItem value="PostgreSQL" label="PostgreSQL">

Since ndc-postgres v1.2.0, mutations are generated automatically. If you are on an earlier version, since
v0.8.0, you can still get autogenerated mutations by adding `"mutationsVersion": "v2"` to your configuration.json.
You can read more about this configuration option and others on the PostgreSQL connector
[configuration docs](/connectors/postgresql/configuration-reference/version-5.mdx).

```bash title="Use the DDN CLI to introspect your MongoDB instance:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```sh title="Then, update your commands:"
ddn command add <connector_name> "*"
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="MongoDB" label="MongoDB">

The MongoDB data connector defines custom commands via
[native mutations](/connectors/mongodb/native-operations/native-mutations.mdx).

Within your connector's directory, you can add a new JSON configuration file to define a native mutation.

```sh title="Create a new directory to store your native mutations:"
mkdir -p <my_subgraph>/connector/<connector_name>/native_mutations/
```

```json title="Create a new file in your connector's directory:"
// native_mutations/insert_user.json
{
  "name": "insertUser",
  "description": "Inserts a user record into the database",

  "arguments": {
    "name": { "type": { "scalar": "string" } }
  },

  "resultType": {
    "object": "InsertUser"
  },
  "objectTypes": {
    "InsertUser": {
      "fields": {
        "ok": { "type": { "scalar": "double" } },
        "n": { "type": { "scalar": "int" } }
      }
    }
  },

  "command": {
    "insert": "users",
    "documents": [{ "name": "{{ name }}" }]
  }
}
```

```bash title="Use the DDN CLI to introspect your MongoDB instance:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```sh title="Then, update your commands:"
ddn command add <connector_name> "*"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ClickHouse" label="ClickHouse">
Commands are currently not supported on ClickHouse.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Lambda connectors

Lambda connectors allow you to execute custom business logic directly via your API. You can learn more about Lambda
connectors in the [docs](/business-logic/overview.mdx).

### Updating a command

Your underlying data source may change over time. You can update your command to reflect these changes.

<Tabs groupId="source-preference" className="api-tabs">
  <TabItem value="PostgreSQL" label="PostgreSQL">

Since ndc-postgres v1.2.0, mutations are generated automatically. If you are on an earlier version, since
v0.8.0, you can still get autogenerated mutations by adding `"mutationsVersion": "v2"` to your configuration.json.
You can read more about this configuration option and others on the PostgreSQL connector
[configuration docs](/connectors/postgresql/configuration-reference/version-5.mdx).

```bash title="Use the DDN CLI to introspect your MongoDB instance:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```sh title="Then, update your commands:"
ddn command update <connector_name> "*"
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="MongoDB" label="MongoDB">

For example if you have a [native mutation](/connectors/mongodb/native-operations/native-mutations.mdx) that inserts a
user you can modify it to include a second field on new documents.

```json title="Edit the existing native mutation in your connector's directory:"
// native_mutations/insert_user.json
{
  "name": "insertUser",
  "description": "Inserts a user record into the database",

  "arguments": {
    "name": { "type": { "scalar": "string" } },
    "role": { "type": { "nullable": { "scalar": "string" } } } // add an argument
  },

  "resultType": {
    "object": "InsertUser"
  },
  "objectTypes": {
    "InsertUser": {
      "fields": {
        "ok": { "type": { "scalar": "double" } },
        "n": { "type": { "scalar": "int" } }
      }
    }
  },

  "command": {
    "insert": "users",
    "documents": [
      {
        "name": "{{ name }}",
        "role": "{{ role }}" // include a field with the value of the new argument
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```bash title="Use the DDN CLI to introspect your MongoDB instance:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```sh title="Then, update your commands:"
ddn command update <connector_name> "*"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ClickHouse" label="ClickHouse">
Commands are currently not supported on ClickHouse.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Deleting a command

```bash title="If you no longer need a command, you can delete it:"
ddn command remove <command_name>
```
