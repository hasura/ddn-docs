# Permissions Protect Data

## Introduction

Permissions allow you to control who can access your data and what they can do with it. You can define permissions to
restrict access to certain models, the fields they contain, and the operations that can be performed on them.

## Lifecycle

:::info New to Hasura DDN?

If you haven't already, have a run through our [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx) guide to set up your Hasura
DDN instance. In the sections below, we'll guide you through how to interact with your metadata and shape your API to
your liking!

### Creating permissions

#### Creating a ModelPermission

To implement row-level security, you can create a permission for a model.

```yaml title=""
---
# e.g., users.hml
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Users
  permissions:
    # admin is present by default
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
    #highlight-start
    - role: user
      select:
        filter:
          fieldComparison:
            field: id
            operator: _eq
            value:
              sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
    #highlight-end
```

The highlighted role above will filter responses from the `Users` field in your API to only those whose `id` matches the
`x-hasura-user-id` passed in the header of the request.

#### Creating a TypePermission

To restrict which fields can be queried, you can create a permission for a type.

```yaml title="Below, a user can only see their own name:"
# e.g., users.hml
---
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: user
  permissions:
    # admin is present by default
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - id
          - name
    #highlight-start
    - role: user
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - name
    #highlight-end
```

#### Creating a CommandPermission

To determine which operations can be performed by which roles, you can create a permission for a command.

```yaml title="In this example, we'll make it so a user can update their own record:"
# e.g., UpdateUsersById.hml
---
kind: CommandPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  commandName: UpdateUsersById
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      allowExecution: true
      #highlight-start
    - role: user
      allowExecution: true
      argumentPresets:
        - argument: keyId
          value:
            sessionVariable: "x-hasura-user-id"
      #highlight-end
```

### Deleting permissions

If you no longer need a permission, you can remove the role from the relevant permissions array in any permission
object.

## Reference

You can learn more about permissions in the metadata reference [docs](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx).
