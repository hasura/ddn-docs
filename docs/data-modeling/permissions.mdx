# Permissions Protect Data

## Introduction

Permissions keep data secure by allowing you to control what can be accessed in your API by which user roles.

When an authentication mode is enabled, the Hasura engine will look for session variables on every API request, it can
then use permissions defined in metadata and the session variables to determine if the request is allowed to proceed.

To learn about authentication modes and supplying the session variables, see
[Authentication](/auth/authentication/index.mdx).

## Lifecycle

Hasura DDN uses Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to determine which user roles can access which data.

The DDN CLI will automatically create permissions for your models and commands when they are added to your metadata for
only the `admin` role by default.

All other permissions for all other user roles must be added manually.

## Create permissions

### Row access

You can create a `ModelPermission` object to implement row-level security and restrict which rows a user can access.

For example, to only allow users to access their own records in the `Users` table:

```yaml title=""
---
# e.g., Users.hml
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Users
  permissions:
    # admin is present by default
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
    #highlight-start
    - role: user
      select:
        filter:
          fieldComparison:
            field: id
            operator: _eq
            value:
              sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
    #highlight-end
```

The highlighted role above will filter responses from the `Users` field in your API to only those whose `id` matches the
`x-hasura-user-id` passed in the header of the request.

### Field access

To restrict which fields can be queried, you can create a `TypePermission` object.

Below, the user role can only access the `name` field, not the `id` field which the admin role can.

```yaml title="The user role can only access their name field:"
# e.g., Users.hml
---
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: Users
  permissions:
    # admin is present by default
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - id
          - name
    #highlight-start
    - role: user
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - name
    #highlight-end
```

### Command (mutation) access

To determine commands can be executed by which roles, you can create a `CommandPermission` object.

```yaml title="In this example, we'll make it so a user can update their own record:"
# e.g., UpdateUsersById.hml
---
kind: CommandPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  commandName: UpdateUsersById # Specify the existing command
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      allowExecution: true
      #highlight-start
    - role: user
      allowExecution: true
      argumentPresets: # Specify the arguments and their values which need to be passed to the command
        - argument: keyId
          value:
            sessionVariable: "x-hasura-user-id" # The value of the argument must equal the session variable
      #highlight-end
```

## Update permissions

Since all permissions are stored in metadata, you can use your text editor to find and update them easily.

For example, to check everything which the `user` role can access, search for `- role: user` and analyze the results.

## Deleting permissions

If you no longer need a role, find all mentions of it in your metadata and remove them all.

If you no longer need a particular permission, simply remove it from the relevant `ModelPermissions`,
`TypePermissions`, or `CommandPermissions` object.

## Reference

You can learn more about permissions in the metadata reference [docs](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx).
