# Semantic Information in PromptQL

PromptQL uses Hasura DDN project metadata to understand your data model and create appropriate query plans. While the
basic metadata provides structural information, adding semantic descriptions helps the LLM better understand the context
and purpose of your data model elements.

## Overview

The `description` field can be added to various metadata elements to provide semantic context:

- Models (database tables)
- Commands (custom functions)
- Fields (table columns)
- Arguments (function parameters)
- Relationships
- Types

## Adding Descriptions

### Commands

When defining custom functions, use the `description` field to explain:

- Purpose of the function
- Expected inputs and their formats
- Return value structure
- Usage examples
- Any important constraints or limitations

**Example: Web Search Command**

```yaml
kind: Command
version: v1
definition:
  name: WebSearch
  graphql:
    rootFieldName: webSearch
    rootFieldKind: Query
  description: |
    Perform a web search using DuckDuckGo and return the results.
    Takes in default input arguments for limit and region.
    limit is the number of results to return, default 10.
    region is the region to search in, default "us-en".

    Args:
        search_term (str): The term to search for.

    Returns:
        List[Result]: A list of search result objects.
  arguments:
    - name: searchTerm
      type: String!
      description: The search query term to look up. Should be a clear, specific search phrase.
    - name: limit
      type: Int!
      description: Maximum number of search results to return. Must be between 1 and 100.
    - name: region
      type: String!
      description: Geographic region code for search results (e.g., us-en, uk-en).
  source:
    dataConnectorName: duckduckgo
    argumentMapping:
      limit: limit
      region: region
      searchTerm: search_term
    dataConnectorCommand:
      function: web_search
  outputType: "[WebSearch!]!"
```

### Models (Database Tables)

For database tables, describe:

- What the table represents
- Key relationships
- Important business rules
- Data lifecycle information

**Example: Customer Table**

```yaml
kind: Model
version: v1
definition:
  name: customers
  description: |
    Stores customer information for both individual and business accounts.
    Customers can have multiple addresses and orders.
    Inactive customers are soft-deleted (is_active=false) rather than removed.
    Customer IDs are globally unique across all regions.
  fields:
    - name: id
      type: uuid
      description: Globally unique identifier for the customer. Used across all systems.
    - name: customer_type
      type: String
      description: Type of customer account: 'individual' or 'business'. Affects pricing and service levels.
    - name: is_active
      type: Boolean
      description: |
        Indicates if the customer account is active.
        False means soft-deleted, but records are retained for compliance.
```

### Fields (Table Columns)

For fields, describe:

- Purpose of the field
- Valid values or ranges
- Business rules affecting the field
- Special formats or patterns

**Example: Order Status Field**

```yaml
name: status
type: String
description: |
  Current status of the order.
  Possible values:
  - 'pending': Initial state
  - 'processing': Payment confirmed
  - 'shipped': Order dispatched
  - 'delivered': Confirmed receipt
  - 'cancelled': Order cancelled
  Only moves forward except for 'cancelled' state.
```

### Relationships

Describe the business meaning of relationships and any important constraints.

**Example: Customer-Order Relationship**

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: customer_orders
  source: customers
  target: orders
  description: |
    Links customers to their orders. One customer can have multiple orders.
    Orders cannot exist without a customer.
    Historical orders are retained even if customer is deactivated.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**

   - Use clear, unambiguous language
   - Include specific constraints and rules
   - Mention edge cases and special handling

2. **Structure Descriptions**

   - Use consistent formatting
   - Break into sections for complex descriptions
   - Include examples for unclear cases

3. **Include Business Context**

   - Explain why, not just what
   - Reference business rules
   - Note dependencies and relationships

4. **Document Constraints**
   - Value ranges and formats
   - Required fields
   - Validation rules
   - Update conditions

## Example: Complete Model with Semantic Information

Here's a comprehensive example showing semantic descriptions at multiple levels:

```yaml
kind: Model
version: v1
definition:
  name: product_inventory
  description: |
    Manages product inventory across all warehouses.
    Updated in real-time with inventory movements.
    Integrates with order processing and procurement systems.
    Maintains historical inventory levels with daily snapshots.
  fields:
    - name: product_id
      type: uuid
      description: Unique product identifier. References master product catalog.

    - name: warehouse_id
      type: uuid
      description: Identifier of the warehouse where product is stored. Foreign key to warehouses table.

    - name: quantity_available
      type: Int
      description: |
        Current available quantity for sale.
        Excludes reserved and damaged items.
        Negative values not allowed.
        Updated via inventory_movement table.

    - name: reorder_point
      type: Int
      description: |
        Quantity threshold that triggers reorder.
        Calculated weekly based on 30-day moving average of daily sales.
        Must be greater than zero.

    - name: last_counted_at
      type: timestamp
      description: |
        Timestamp of last physical inventory count.
        Updated by inventory audit process.
        Should not be more than 30 days old.

  relationships:
    - name: warehouse
      target: warehouses
      description: Links to warehouse details. Each product-warehouse combination must be unique.

    - name: product
      target: products
      description: Links to product master data. Inactive products still maintain inventory records.
```

## Impact of Semantic Metadata on PromptQL

Good semantic information helps PromptQL:

- Generate more accurate query plans
- Better understand business rules and constraints
- Make appropriate choices for data filtering and aggregation
- Provide more relevant responses to natural language queries
- Handle edge cases correctly

The more crisper and relevant context you provide through descriptions, the better PromptQL can understand and work with
your data model.
