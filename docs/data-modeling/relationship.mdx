# Relationships Connect Data

## Introduction

Relationships allow you to connect data, enabling you to query data across multiple entities.

Examples include:

- Querying a `Customer` and at the same time getting their `Orders` and each `Product` item in those orders.
- Querying an `Order` and also getting a live currency conversion for the value of the order.

## Create a relationship

### Using the DDN CLI

The DDN CLI and your data connectors will detect many relationships in your data sources automatically, for instance
from foreign keys in a relational database, and once introspected, you can add them to your metadata.

```bash title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Add relationships to your metadata:"
ddn relationship add <connector_link_name> <collection_name>
```

### Manually adding a relationship

Relationships can also be manually added to your metadata.

Relationships are defined in metadata from an [object type](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx#objecttype-objecttype), to a
[model](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) or [command](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx). But since models and commands
are also defined with object types, you can think of relationships as being between models and commands.

As an example, you can configure a relationship so that you can also get Orders when querying a Customer.

```yaml title="Create a relationship in your metadata:"
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  sourceType: Customers # The existing source object type which also defines the model
  name: orders # A name we want to use when we query the Orders from the Customer
  target:
    model: # The target can be a model or a command
      name: Orders # The existing model that we want to access when we query the Orders from the Customer
      relationshipType: Array # The relationship type which can be Object or Array. Since a customer can have many orders, we use an Array.
  mapping: # The mapping defines which field on the source object type maps to which field on the target model
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: customerId # The existing field on the source object type that we want to map to the target model
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: customerId # The existing field on the target model that we want to map to the source object type
```

By defining this `Relationship` object, all other [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) or
[commands](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) whose output type is the source object type in the relationship will now
have a connection to the target model or command.

## Update a relationship

Your underlying data source may change over time. You can update your relationship to reflect these changes.

For example, imagine you have a `post => user` relationship, and the posts previously used a field named `userId`. Now,
however, that field name has changed to `authorId`.

First, update your connector configuration and models to reflect the changed field name.

```bash title="Update your source introspection:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Then, update your model:"
ddn model update <connector_name> users
```

Now, you can either delete the existing `Relationship` object and use the DDN CLI to add it again:

```bash title="Delete your existing relationship manually and add it again:"
ddn relationship add <connector_link_name> <collection_name>
```

Or you can update the `Relationship` object manually:

```yaml title="Edit the existing metadata file:"
# In whichever HML file contains your relationship
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: user
  source: Post
  target:
    model:
      name: User
      relationshipType: Object
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: authorId # The line which has changed
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: id
```

## Delete a relationship

If you no longer need a relationship, simply delete the `Relationship` metadata object manually. It is fully
self-contained.

## Reference

You can learn more about relationships in the metadata reference [docs](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx).
