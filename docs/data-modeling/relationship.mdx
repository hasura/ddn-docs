# Relationships Connect Data

## Introduction

Relationships allow you to connect data, enabling you to query data across multiple entities.

:::info New to Hasura DDN?

If you haven't already, have a run through our [Quickstart](/quickstart.mdx) guide to set up your Hasura DDN instance.
In the sections below, we'll guide you through how to interact with your metadata and shape your API to your liking!

### Creating a relationship

To query data across multiple entities, you'll first need to create a relationship between them.

As an example, you can configure a relationship between a `posts` collection and a `users` collection. This assumes that
both collections already have tracked models in your metadata, and that the `Post` model has a field called `userId`
that matches values in the `id` field of `User`.

```yaml title="Create relationship in your metadata:"
# We recommend adding this to the parent model's HML file
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: user
  source: Post
  target:
    model:
      name: User
      relationshipType: Object
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: userId
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: id
```

### Updating a relationship

Your underlying data source may change over time. You can update your relationship to reflect these changes.

For example, imagine you have a `post-user` relationship, and the posts previously used a field named `userId`. Now,
however, that field name has changed to `authorId`.

First, update your connector configuration and models to reflect the changed field name.

```bash title="Update your DataConnectorLink:"
ddn connector-link update <connector_name> --subgraph <path_to_subgraph.yaml>
```

```bash title="Then, update your model:"
ddn model update <connector_name> users
```

Then edit the relationship configuration in subgraph metadata.

```yaml title="Edit the existing metadata file:"
# In whichever HML file contains your relationship
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: user
  source: Post
  target:
    model:
      name: User
      relationshipType: Object
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: authorId # this is the line that has changed
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: id
```

### Deleting a relationship

If you no longer need a relationship, simply delete the metadata object.

## Reference

You can learn more about relationships in the metadata reference [docs](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx).
