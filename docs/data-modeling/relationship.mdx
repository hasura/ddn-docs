# Relationships Connect Data

## Introduction

Relationships allow you to connect data, enabling you to query data across multiple entities.

Examples include:

- Querying a `Customer` and at the same time getting their `Orders` and each `Product` item in those orders. (Model to
  Model)
- Querying a `Customer` and also getting the analytics of their app usage from another data source. (Model to Model in
  another subgraph or data connector)
- Querying an `Order` and also getting a live currency conversion for the value of the order enabled with a lambda data
  connector with a connection to a currency exchange API. (Model to Command)

Relationships can be added between _any_ kind of semantically related models and/or commands. They do not need to be
related in the data source by, for example, a foreign key. They also do not need to be backed by the same data source or
be in the same subgraph.

## Lifecycle

Many relationships can be created automatically by the DDN CLI from detected underlying connections such as foreign
keys. In such cases the lifecycle in creating a relationship in your metadata is as follows:

1. Introspect your data source using the DDN CLI with the relevant data connector to fetch the entity resources.
2. Add the detected relationships to your metadata with the DDN CLI.
3. Create a build of your supergraph API with the DDN CLI.
4. Serve your build as your API with the Hasura engine either locally or in the cloud.
5. Iterate on your API by repeating this process or by editing your metadata manually as needed.

If the relationship cannot be detected automatically, you can easily manually create a relationship in your metadata and
then perform lifecycle steps 3-5 from above as needed.

## Create a relationship

Relationships are defined in metadata from an
[object type](/reference/metadata-reference/types.mdx#objecttype-objecttype), to a
[model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx) or [command](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx). But since
models and commands are also defined with object types, you can think of relationships as being between models and/or
commands.

The target command can be enabled with a a custom piece of business logic on a lambda data connector, or a native
mutation operation.

### Using the DDN CLI

The DDN CLI and your data connectors will detect many relationships in your data sources automatically, for instance
from foreign keys in a relational database, and once introspected, you can add them to your metadata.

```bash title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Show the found relationships:"
ddn connector show-resources <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Add a relationship to your metadata:"
ddn relationship add <connector_link_name> <collection_name>
```

Or optionally add all relationships found for a connector at once:

```bash
ddn relationship add <connector_link_name> "*"
```

:::info Context for CLI commands

Note that the above CLI commands work without also adding the relevant subgraph to the command with the `--subgraph`
flag because this has been set in the CLI context. You can learn more about creating and switching contexts in the
[CLI context](/) section. {/* TODO: Add link */}

:::

### Manually creating a relationship

Relationships can also be manually added to your metadata.

The [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) can help you to author
relationships.

For example, you can configure a relationship so that you can also get Orders when querying a Customer.

```yaml title="Create a relationship in your metadata:"
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  sourceType: Customers # The existing source object type which also defines the model
  name: orders # A name we want to use when we query the Orders from the Customer
  target:
    model: # The target can be a model or a command
      name: Orders # The existing model that we want to access when we query the Orders from the Customer
      relationshipType: Array # The relationship type which can be Object or Array. Since a customer can have many orders, we use an Array.
  mapping: # The mapping defines which field on the source object type maps to which field on the target model
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: customerId # The existing field on the source object type that we want to map to the target model
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: customerId # The existing field on the target model that we want to map to the source object type
```

By defining this `Relationship` object, all other [models](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx) or
[commands](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx) whose output type is the source object type in the relationship
will now have a connection to the target model or command.

Learn more about the [Relationship](/reference/metadata-reference/relationships.mdx) object.

## Update a relationship

Your underlying data source may change over time. You can update your relationship to reflect these changes.

If you have an automatically detected relationship and a property on the source object type has changed, you can update
the relationship to reflect this change.

First, update your connector configuration and models.

```bash title="Update your source introspection:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Then, update your model:"
ddn model update <connector_name> <model_name>
```

Now, you can either delete the existing `Relationship` object and use the DDN CLI to add it again:

```bash title="Delete your existing relationship manually and add it again:"
ddn relationship add <connector_link_name> <collection_name>
```

Or you can update the `Relationship` object manually. Learn more about the
[Relationship](/reference/metadata-reference/relationships.mdx) object.

## Delete a relationship

If you no longer need a relationship, simply delete the `Relationship` metadata object manually. It is fully
self-contained.

## Tutorials

These tutorials follow on from the tutorials in the
[How to Build with DDN section](/how-to-build-with-ddn/overview.mdx).

### Creating a relationship

#### Between a model and a model

<Tabs groupId="source-preference" className="api-tabs">
  <TabItem value="PostgreSQL" label="PostgreSQL">

<PostgresRelationshipCreateModelToModel />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="MongoDB" label="MongoDB">

<MongoDBRelationshipCreateModelToModel />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ClickHouse" label="ClickHouse">

<ClickHouseRelationshipCreateModelToModel />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Between a model and a command

We will use a business logic function defined in a lambda data connector to build a model to command relationship for
all connector types.

<details>
  <summary>Create a custom function with the TypeScript lambda data connector to use in the tutorials</summary>

Initialize a new data connector with the TypeScript connector.

```bash title="Run the following command in your DDN project directory:"
ddn connector init my_ts -i
```

- Select `hasura/nodejs` from the list of connectors.
- Accept the suggested port.
- Edit the `functions.ts` file in the connector directory with the `shoutName` function.

```ts
export function shoutName(name: string) {
  return `${name.toUpperCase()}`;
}
```

```bash title="Introspect the connector:"
ddn connector introspect my_ts
```

Then, we can add the model made available from the introspection.

```bash title="Track the function:"
ddn command add my_ts shoutName
```

</details>

To create a relationship between the `Users` model and the `shoutName` function (see the drop-down above for how to
implement this function) we can create the following relationship. Using the
[VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) makes the authoring and
validation of the relationship easier.

```yaml title="Create a relationship:"
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: shoutName # Define a name to expose in the supergraph API
  sourceType: Users # The existing source object type (which also defines the source model Users)
  target:
    command: # The target is a command
      name: ShoutName # The name of the existing command we have defined in metadata
      subgraph: app # The existing subgraph the command is defined in
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: name # The field on the source object type that we want to provide to the target command as an argument
      target:
        argument:
          argumentName: name # The name of the argument on the target command that we want to map to the source field
```

```bash title="Create a build of your supergraph API:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```bash title="Serve your build as your API locally:"
ddn run docker-start
ddn console --local
```

We can now query the `Users` model and also return the result of the `shoutName` function with its default argument of
`name`.

```graphql title="Query the Users model:"
query {
  users {
    name
    shoutName
  }
}
```

```json title="Result:"
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "name": "Alice",
        "shoutName": "ALICE"
      },
      {
        "name": "Bob",
        "shoutName": "BOB"
      },
      {
        "name": "Charlie",
        "shoutName": "CHARLIE"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

With relationships and custom commands we can transform or enrich any data.

### Updating a relationship

Your underlying data source may change over time. You can update your relationship to reflect these changes.

If you have an automatically detected relationship and a property on the source object type has changed, you can update
the relationship to reflect this change.

First, update your connector configuration and models.

```

```bash title="Then, update your model:"

```

Now, you can either delete the existing `Relationship` object and use the DDN CLI to add it again:

```bash title="Delete your existing relationship manually and add it again:"
ddn relationship add <connector_link_name> <collection_name>

## Relationships across subgraphs

### Single-repo relationships

In a single-repo setup, relationships are straightforward to manage. All subgraphs are in the same repository and the
[Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) can be used to assist
with authoring relationships, providing auto-complete and validation.

### Cross-repo relationships {#cross-repo-relationships}

:::info Advanced plan

You will need a project on the [DDN Advanced plan](https://hasura.io/pricing) to use multi-repo federation and
cross-repo relationships.

:::

In a [multi-repo setup](/project-configuration/subgraphs/working-with-multiple-repositories.mdx), while working with an
independent subgraph in its own repository, you may want to relate objects that reside in different repositories, some
of which you may not have access to.

In these cases the Hasura VS Code extension cannot validate the entirety of the `Relationship` object and you will
manually author cross-repo relationships and ensure that the field mappings are correct. However, upon creating a
supergraph build, all cross-subgraph metadata is validated to prevent mistakes from being deployed to the final API.

You can still easily use the Hasura DDN console to explore the supergraph and test relationships across subgraphs once
you have created a build.

If you perform a _local_ supergraph build using the CLI (ie. `ddn supergraph build local`), cross-repo relationships
will be ignored and will not be validated. If you run the build locally you will only see the subgraphs in that
repository, and any relationships to subgraphs from other repositories will be missing.

### Example

Let's say you have a supergraph with two subgraphs, each managed in different repositories: `users` and `products`.

The `users` subgraph in repo 'A' has a `User` type with a field called `user_favorite_product_id`.

The `products` subgraph in repo 'B' has a `Product` type with a field called `id`.

To create a relationship between these two types in different repositories, you would create a `Relationship` object in
the `users` subgraph metadata as normal.

The LSP is able to understand that the `Product` type is in a different subgraph to which it does not have access and
will not give a warning on the foreign type.

```yaml
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: favorite_product
  sourceType: User
  target:
    model:
      name: Product
      subgraph: products
      relationshipType: Object
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: user_favorite_product_id
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: id
```

This `Relationship` object defines a relationship called `favorite_product` from the `User` type to the `Product` type.
The `mapping` field specifies how the `user_favorite_product_id` field in the `User` type maps to the `id` field in the
`Product` type.

After defining the cross-repo relationship, it's important to note that you won't be able to test this locally. To see
the relationship in action, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new supergraph build on DDN using the `ddn supergraph build create` command. (Subgraph builds do not get an
   API, so supergraph builds are required to test.)
2. You can then use the Hasura DDN console to explore and test the relationship across subgraphs.
3. If you have admin permissions, you can apply the subgraph to the supergraph with the `ddn subgraph apply` command.

Remember, cross-repo relationships only come into effect when the subgraphs are combined in the DDN environment. Local
development and testing are limited to the scope of your current repository.

With this relationship defined, you can now query the `favorite_product` field on the `User` type to retrieve the
related `Product`.

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    favorite_product {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
