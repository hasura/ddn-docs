The process for adding a native query for PostgreSQL is:

- Create a new SQL file in your connector directory.
- Name the file with how you want to reference it in your supergraph API.
- Add the SQL for your native query to the file.
- Use the DDN CLI plugin for the PostgreSQL connector to add the native query to the connector's configuration eg:

```bash title="Add the native query to the connector's configuration:"
ddn connector plugin \
  --connector subgraph_name/connector/connector_name/connector.yaml \
  -- native-operation create \
  --operation-path path/to/sql_file_name.sql \
  --kind query
```

- Introspect your PostgreSQL data connector to fetch the latest resources.

```bash
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

- Show the found resources to see the new native query.

```bash
ddn connector show-resources <connector_name>
```

- Add the model for the native query.

```bash
ddn model add <connector_link_name> <model_name>
```

- Rebuild and serve your supergraph API.
