Within your connector's directory, you can add a new file with a `.sql` extension to define a native mutation.

```sh title="Create a new directory to store your native mutations:"
mkdir -p app/connector/my_pg/native_operations/mutations/
```

```sql title="Create a new file in your connector's directory:"
-- native_operations/mutations/update_post_titles_by_age.sql
UPDATE posts
SET title = CASE
    WHEN title ~ ' - age \d+$' THEN regexp_replace(title, ' - age \d+$', ' - age ' || {{ age }})
    ELSE title || ' - age ' || {{ age }}
END
FROM users
WHERE posts.user_id = users.id
    AND users.age = {{ age }}
RETURNING
    posts.id,
    posts.title,
    posts.user_id,
    users.name,
    users.age;
```

Arguments are passed to the native mutation as variables surrounded by double curly braces `{{ }}`. This mutation will
update the title of all posts for a given age by appending the age to the title.

```sh title="Then, use the PostgreSQL connector's plugin to add the native query to your connector's configuration:"
ddn connector plugin \
  --connector app/connector/my_pg/connector.yaml \
  -- \
  native-operation create \
  --operation-path native_operations/mutations/update_post_titles_by_age.sql \
  --kind mutation
```

```sh title="Introspect your PostgreSQL instance:"
ddn connector introspect my_pg
```

```sh title="Show the found resources:"
ddn connector show-resources my_pg
```

```sh title="Then, add your model:"
ddn command add my_pg update_post_titles_by_age
```

```title="Build and serve your supergraph API:"
ddn supergraph build local
ddn run docker-start
```

Now in your console you can run the following query to see the results:

```graphql title="Run the following mutation:"
mutation UpdatePostTitlesByAge {
  updatePostTitlesByAge(age: "25") {
    affectedRows
    returning {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="The response will be:"
{
  "data": {
    "updatePostTitlesByAge": {
      "affectedRows": 2,
      "returning": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "My First Post - age 25"
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "title": "Another Post - age 25"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a native mutation in a PostgreSQL connector. We added a native mutation to
our PostgreSQL connector by creating a new file with a `.sql` extension in the `native_operations/mutations` directory.

We then used the `ddn connector plugin` command to add the native mutation to our connector's configuration.

We then introspected our PostgreSQL instance to find the new native mutation and added it to our model.

Finally, we built and served our supergraph API to see the new native mutation in action, which demonstrated how to
update the title of all posts for a given age using PostgreSQL's `UPDATE` statement.
