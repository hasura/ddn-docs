Within your connector's directory, you can add a new file with a `.sql` extension to define a native mutation.

```sh title="Create a new directory to store your native mutations:"
mkdir -p app/connector/my_pg/native_operations/mutations/
```

```sql title="Create a new file in your connector's directory:"
-- native_operations/queries/order_users_of_same_age.sql
SELECT
    id,
    name,
    age,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY age ORDER BY name ASC) AS rank_within_age
FROM
    users
WHERE
    age = {{ age }}
```

Arguments are passed to the native query as variables surrounded by double curly braces `{{ }}`.

```sh title="Then, use the PostgreSQL connector's plugin to add the native query to your connector's configuration:"
ddn connector plugin \
  --connector app/connector/my_pg/connector.yaml \
  -- \
  native-operation create \
  --operation-path native_operations/queries/order_users_of_same_age.sql \
  --kind query
```

```sh title="Introspect your PostgreSQL instance:"
ddn connector introspect my_pg
```

```sh title="Show the found resources:"
ddn connector show-resources my_pg
```

```sh title="Then, add your model:"
ddn model add my_pg order_users_of_same_age
```

Let's add a few more users to make this native query example more interesting:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Dan', 25), ('Erika', 25), ('Fatima', 25), ('Gabe', 25);
```

```title="Build and serve your supergraph API:"
ddn supergraph build local
ddn run docker-start
```

Now in your console you can run the following query to see the results:

```graphql
query UsersOfSameAge {
  orderUsersOfSameAge(args: { age: 25 }) {
    id
    name
    age
    orderWithinAge
  }
}
```
