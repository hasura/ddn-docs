Following on from the [PostgreSQL tutorial in the How to Build with DDN](/how-to-build-with-ddn/with-postgresql.mdx)
section, you can create a relationship between two models which already have a foreign key relationship defined in the
database.

In the tutorial, we created a `posts` to `users` relationship. Let's now add the inverse, detected automatically by the
same foreign key as a relationship between the `Users` to `Posts` models.

```bash title="View the available resources from the data connector:"
ddn connector show-resources my_pg
```

Add the users realtionship which was found automatically due to the foreign key.

```bash title="Add the relationship:"
ddn relationship add my_pg users
```

Now, you can build your supergraph API, serve it, and query your data.

```bash title="Build your supergraph API:"
ddn supergraph build local
ddn run docker-start
```

Now you can query your data with your relationship in the console get users and their posts.

```bash title="Query your data:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql
query UsersWithPosts {
  users {
    id
    posts {
      title
    }
    name
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice"
        "posts": [
          {
            "title": "My First Post"
          },
          {
            "title": "Another Post"
          }
        ],
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Bob"
        "posts": [
          {
            "title": "Bob's Post"
          }
        ],

      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Charlie"
        "posts": [
          {
            "title": "Hello World"
          }
        ],
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
