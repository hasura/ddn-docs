The process of creating a native mutation for PostgreSQL is the following.

Within your connector's directory, you can add a new file with a `.sql` extension to define a native mutation.

Then, use the PostgreSQL connector's plugin to add the native query to your connector's configuration:

```sh title="Then, use the PostgreSQL connector's plugin to add the native mutation to your connector's configuration:"
ddn connector plugin \
  --connector app/connector/<connector_name>/connector.yaml \
  -- \
  native-operation create \
  --operation-path <path>/<to>/<your>/<native>/<mutation>/<mutation_name>.sql \
  --kind mutation
```

```sh title="Introspect your PostgreSQL instance:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```sh title="Show the found resources:"
ddn connector show-resources <connector_name>
```

```sh title="Then, add your model:"
ddn command add <connector_name> <mutation_name>
```

```title="Build and serve your supergraph API:"
ddn supergraph build local
ddn run docker-start
```

Now in your console you can run the mutation with GraphQL.
