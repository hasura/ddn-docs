Within your connector's directory, you can add a new file with a `.json` extension to define a native mutation.

```sh title="Create a new directory to store your native mutations:"
mkdir -p app/connector/my_mongo/native_operations/mutations/
```

Let's create a [native mutation](/reference/connectors/mongodb/native-operations/native-mutations.mdx) that adds a new
user to the database with a name and age using an
[aggregation pipeline](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/).

```json title="Create a new native mutation file in your connector's directory:"
// native_mutations/create_user.json
{
  "name": "createUser",
  "description": "Create a new user with name and age",
  "resultType": {
    "object": "CreateUserResult"
  },
  "arguments": {
    "name": {
      "type": {
        "scalar": "string"
      }
    },
    "age": {
      "type": {
        "scalar": "int"
      }
    }
  },
  "objectTypes": {
    "CreateUserResult": {
      "fields": {
        "ok": {
          "type": {
            "scalar": "int"
          }
        },
        "n": {
          "type": {
            "scalar": "int"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "command": {
    "insert": "users",
    "documents": [
      {
        "name": "{{ name }}",
        "age": "{{ age }}",
        "user_id": {
          "$size": {
            "$ifNull": [
              {
                "$objectToArray": "$$ROOT"
              },
              []
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Arguments are passed to the native mutation as variables surrounded by double curly braces `{{ }}`.

```sh title="Introspect your MongoDB instance:"
ddn connector introspect my_mongo
```

```sh title="Show the found resources:"
ddn connector show-resources my_mongo
```

```sh title="Then, add your model:"
ddn command add my_mongo createUser
```

```title="Build and serve your supergraph API:"
ddn supergraph build local
ddn run docker-start
```

Now in your console you can run the following query to see the results:

```graphql title="Run the following mutation:"
mutation CreateUser {
  createUser(age: 25, name: "Peter") {
    n
    ok
  }
}
```

```json title="The response will be:"
{
  "data": {
    "createUser": {
      "n": 1,
      "ok": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a native mutation in a MongoDB connector. We added a native mutation to our
MongoDB connector by creating a new aggregation pipeline file in the `native_operations/mutations` directory.

We then introspected our MongoDB instance to find the new native mutation and added it to our model.

Finally, we built and served our supergraph API to see the new native mutation in action, which demonstrated how to
create a new user document in MongoDB using the `insert` command.
