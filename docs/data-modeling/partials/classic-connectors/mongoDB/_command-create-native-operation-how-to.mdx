In MongoDB, you can create a [native operation](/reference/connectors/mongodb/native-operations/index.mdx) by using an
[aggregation pipeline](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/) in a JSON file by adding it to
your connector's directory.

See the syntax for MongoDB native operations [here](/reference/connectors/mongodb/native-operations/syntax.mdx).

Store your native operation in an appropriate directory, possibly named for the operation type, in your connector's
directory.

```sh title="Introspect your MongoDB instance:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```sh title="Show the found resources:"
ddn connector show-resources <connector_name>
```

```sh title="Then, add your model:"
ddn command add <connector_name> <operation_name>
```

```title="Build and serve your supergraph API:"
ddn supergraph build local
ddn run docker-start
```

Now in your console you can run the operation with GraphQL.

See the tutorial for creating a native operation in MongoDB [here](#via-native-operation-tutorials).
