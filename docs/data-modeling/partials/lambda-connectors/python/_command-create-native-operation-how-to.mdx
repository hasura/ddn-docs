You can run whatever arbitrary code you want in your Python connector and expose it as a GraphQL mutation or query in
your supergraph API.

```sh title="Initalize a new connector and select hasura/python from the list:"
ddn connector init my_py -i
```

```py title="Replace the functions.py contents with your own custom code:"
from hasura_ndc import start
from hasura_ndc.function_connector import FunctionConnector

connector = FunctionConnector()

@connector.register_query
def my_custom_code(my_input: str) -> str:
  # Do something with the input
  return "My output"

if __name__ == "__main__":
  start(connector)
```

By adding the `@connector.register_query` decorator, we are indicating that this function is to be exposed as an NDC
function which will ultimately show up as a GraphQL query. If you use `@connector.register_mutation` instead, the
function will be exposed as an NDC procedure which will be a GraphQL mutation.

```bash title="Introspect the connector:"
ddn connector introspect my_py
```

```bash title="Track the function:"
ddn command add my_py my_custom_code
```

```bash title="Create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```bash title="Start your services:"
ddn run docker-start
```

```bash title="Open your development console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="You can now query your native operation:"
query MyCustomCode {
  myCustomCode(myInput: "My input")
}
```

```json title="You will see a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "myCustomCode": "My output"
  }
}
```
