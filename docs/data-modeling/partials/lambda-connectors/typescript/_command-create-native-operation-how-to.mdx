You can run whatever arbitrary code you want in your TypeScript connector and expose it as a GraphQL mutation or query
in your supergraph API.

```sh title="Initalize a new connector and select hasura/nodejs from the list:"
ddn connector init my_ts -i
```

```ts title="Replace the functions.ts contents with your own custom code:"
/**
 * @readonly
 */
export function myCustomCode(myInput: string): string {
  // Do something with the input
  return "My output";
}
```

By adding the `@readonly` tag, we are indicating that this function is a read-only operation to be exposed as an NDC
function which will ulitmately show up as a GraphQL query. Leaving the tag off will expose the function as an NDC
procedure which will be a GraphQL mutation.

```bash title="Introspect the connector:"
ddn connector introspect my_ts
```

```bash title="Track the function:"
ddn command add my_ts myCustomCode
```

```bash title="Create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```bash title="Start your services:"
ddn run docker-start
```

```bash title="Open your development console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="You can now query your native operation:"
query MyCustomCode {
  myCustomCode(myInput: "My input")
}
```

```json title="You will see a response like this:"
{
  "data": {
    "myCustomCode": "My output"
  }
}
```
