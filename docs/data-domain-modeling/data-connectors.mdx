# OpenDD Data Connectors

## Introduction

A `DataConnector` is a way to specify where your data comes from and how it can be used. It can connect to various types
of data, like SQL databases, NoSQL databases, REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, files, and more.

In the Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD spec), every data connector must have a connector URL and a schema. This
schema defines how the data is structured and what operations can be performed on the data.

Once you've declared a data connector, you can use it in your [model's](/data-domain-modeling/models.mdx) configuration
by [referencing it with the `source`](/data-domain-modeling/models.mdx/#source) property, which connects that model to
the respective data connector.

## Description

To create a data connector object, you will need to define an object with `kind: DataConnector` and `version: v1`.
The object `definition` should include four fields: `name`, `url`, `headers` and `schema`.

```yaml
kind: DataConnector
version: v1
definition:
  name: <DataConnectorName>
  url: <DataConnectorURL>
  headers: <DataConnectorHeaders>
  schema: <SchemaResponse>
```

| Field     | Type                                            | Required | Description                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`    | `String`                                        | true     | Name of the Data Connector.                                                                                                            |
| `url`     | [`DataConnectorURL`](#dataconnectorurl)         | true     | URL to access the data connector.                                                                                                      |
| `headers` | [`DataConnectorHeaders`](#dataconnectorheaders) | true     | Request headers to pass on to the data connector.                                                                                      |
| `schema`  | [`SchemaResponse`](#schemaresponse)             | true     | The schema response from the data connector. This includes `scalar_types`, `object_type`, `collections`, `functions` and `procedures`. |

### DataConnectorURL

`DataConnectorURL` is an object that either defines a single URL for the data connector or separate read/write URLs
for the data connector. For example, it can take either of the following

```yaml
url:
  singleUrl: <URL for the data connector>
```

```yaml
url:
  read: <Read URL for the data connector>
  write: <Write URL for the data connector>
```

Read/Write URLs are used to access the appropriate data connector based on the GraphQL operation type. For example, if
the operation type is `Query` or `Subscription`, then the `read` URL will be used to access the data connector
connector. Similarly, for a `Mutation` operation, the `write` URL will be used.

### DataConnectorHeaders

`DataConnectorHeaders` is an object that defines the headers to be forwarded to the data connector when making requests.
The keys of this object are header names and the values are the header values. E.g., if a bearer authorization token
needs to be forwarded, the headers field would be:

```yaml
headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### SchemaResponse

`SchemaResponse` is an object that defines the types, schema, functions, etc. of the data connector. This is usually
provided by the `/schema` endpoint of the data connector. It contains the following fields:

```yaml
schema:
  scalar_types: <ScalarTypes>
  object_types: <ObjectTypes>
  collections: <Collections>
  functions: <Functions>
  procedures: <Procedures>
```

The structure and detailed documentation of these fields can be found
[here](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/specification/schema/index.html).

## Example

In this example, we'll create a data connector for the Chinook data set. The Chinook data set is a sample database that
represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, tracks, and more. Each object we reference above
is present in the complete example below:

```yaml
kind: DataConnector
version: v1
definition:
  name: my_data_connector
  url:
    singleUrl: http://localhost:8080
  schema:
    scalar_types:
      String:
        aggregate_functions: {}
        comparison_operators:
          like:
            argument_type:
              type: named
              name: String
        update_operators: {}
      Int:
        aggregate_functions:
          min:
            result_type:
              type: nullable
              underlying_type:
                type: named
                name: Int
          max:
            result_type:
              type: nullable
              underlying_type:
                type: named
                name: Int
        comparison_operators: {}
        update_operators: {}
