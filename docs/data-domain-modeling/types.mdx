# OpenDD Types

## Introduction

In the OpenDD spec in Hasura, types serve as the fundamental elements that define the structure of your data.

Being able to define types in your data domain is beneficial because it provides you with the flexibility to define them
separately from the types in your data source.

The specification employs a concrete type system that includes both primitive types and user-defined types. All
subsequent layers, such as models, commands, and relationships are defined in terms of these types.

The types can be one of the following:

| OpenDD Type | Description                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primitive   | These are the basic types `Int`, `Float`, `Boolean`, or `String`        |
| Container   | These are types that can hold other types such as `Nullable` or `Array` |
| Custom      | These are user-defined types, such as `ScalarType` or `ObjectType`      |

The spec also allows you to map existing data source scalars to types in your data domain.

Container types are types that can contain other primitive or custom types. Currently, container types can be nullable
or arrays. Nullability in your data source types are represented using the `Nullable` container type.

You can also define custom types by either aliasing existing types (such as primitives or custom), or you can define a
type with fields. In turn, the fields themselves can be a primitive or another custom type.

[Scalar type representation](#scalar-type-representation) helps in mapping data source scalars to any of the OpenDD
primitive, container or custom types.

## Primitive and container types {#primitive-and-container-types}

Primitive types don't have any metadata structure and simply use the names `Int` / `Float` / `Boolean` / `String`
directly.

### Metadata structure

Container types are defined as:

```yaml
Nullable: <Type>
```

```yaml
Array: <Type>
```

| Value  | Description                                                                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Type` | String in case of primitive or custom types. An object in the case of container types. |

### Examples

Examples of container types:

```yaml
name: category
type:
  Nullable: ProductCategory
```

```yaml
name: tags
type:
  Array: String
```

## Scalar types {#scalar-types}

In the OpenDD spec, you can alias types by defining an object with `"kind": "ScalarType"`. To define a `ScalarType` you
need to define a name and an optional representation. This `representation` field can refer to any existing primitive,
container or custom type and can be a string or an object.

### Metadata structure

```yaml
kind: ScalarType
name: <TypeName>
representation: <Type>
```

| Field            | Type     | Required | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`           | `String` | true     | Name of the type.                                                                      |
| `representation` | `Type`   | false    | String in case of primitive or custom types. An object in the case of container types. |

[//]: # "TODO link above"

### Examples

```yaml
kind: ScalarType
name: UUID
representation: String
```

```yaml
- kind: ScalarType
  name: Tag
  representation: String
- kind: ScalarType
  name: Tags
  representation:
    Array: Tag
```

```yaml
kind: ScalarType
name: OpaqueDate
```

## Object types {#object-types}

In the OpenDD spec, completely new types can be created by defining an object with `"kind": "ObjectType"`. You need to
also define a name and the fields for this type.

### Metadata structure

```yaml
kind: ObjectType
name: <TypeName>
fields:
  - name: field1
    type: <Type>
  - name: field2
    type: <Type>
```

| Field    | Type      | Required | Description       |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| `name`   | `String`  | true     | Name of the type. |
| `fields` | `[Field]` | true     | List of fields.   |

#### Field

| Field  | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                               |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name` | `String` | true     | Name of the field .                                                                                       |
| `type` | `Type`   | true     | Type of the field. String in case of primitive or custom types. An object in the case of container types. |

[//]: # "TODO link above"

### Examples

```yaml
kind: ObjectType
name: author
fields:
  - name: author_id
    type: Int
  - name: first_name
    type: String
  - name: last_name
    type: String
```

## Scalar type representation for data connectors {#scalar-type-representation}

A scalar type from a data source can be represented as an OpenDD type by defining an object with
`"kind": "DataConnectorScalarRepresentation"`. To define a scalar type representation, you need to have a data source
name, a scalar name and a type representation. This `representation` can refer to any existing primitive, container, or
custom type and can be a string or an object.

It is necessary to map all available scalars from a data source to OpenDD types.

### Metadata structure

```yaml
kind: DataConnectorScalarRepresentation
dataSource: <DataSourceName>
scalarType: <ScalarTypeName>
representation: <Type>
```

| Field            | Type     | Required | Description                                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dataSource`     | `String` | true     | Name of the data source.                                                           |
| `scalarType`     | `String` | true     | Name of the scalar type from the data source.                                      |
| `representation` | `Type`   | true     | String in case of primitive or custom types. An object in case of container types. |

### Examples

1. Mapping a `text` scalar type from the `my_source` source to a primitive `String` type.

```yaml
kind: DataConnectorScalarRepresentation
dataSource: my_source
scalarType: text
representation: String
```

2. Mapping a PostgreSQL scalar `geography` to a custom object type.

```yaml
- kind: ObjectType
  name: Geography
  fields:
    - name: type
      type: String
    - name: coordinates
      type:
        Array: Float
- kind: DataConnectorScalarRepresentation
  dataSource: pg_source
  scalarType: geography
  representation: Geography
```
