# Summary

If you've used Hasura before, you'll notice that the Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD spec) is similar to
Hasura v2 metadata, but with many extra capabilities.

The new Hasura DDN tooling has built-in capabilities to autogenerate the OpenDD spec metadata from your existing data
via the GUI console or CLI terminal commands, or you can also author the your metadata manually.

### How is it different from Hasura v2 metadata

- Hasura V2 metadata was specifically designed for Hasura, whereas the OpenDD spec is a specification that can also be
  used outside Hasura as a source of truth for your data domain.
- Functionally, the V2 metadata relied on the data source for information like columns and fields, whereas OpenDD
  metadata is independent of the data source. In OpenDD, all fields and types are defined within the specification
  itself which eliminating the necessity for data source schema introspection at startup to generate a GraphQL schema.
  Instead, data source introspection occurs as part of the metadata build process.
- In v2, metadata was stored as a JSON blob in a database, in Hasura DDN, OpenDD metadata is built, it is a binary
  file that is applied to the Hasura project.
