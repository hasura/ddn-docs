# OpenDD Permissions

## Introduction

The OpenDD Spec lets you define permissions, (also known as access control or authorization rules) on
[output types](./types.mdx), [models](./models.mdx) and [commands](./commands.mdx) in your data domain.

The following types of permissions are defined in the [OpenDD spec](/data-domain-modeling/overview.mdx):

- `TypeOutputPermissions` define which fields are allowed to be accessed by a role. Defining permissions on output types
  is useful, as multiple models can return the same output type.
- `ModelSelectPermissions` define which objects or rows within the model are allowed to be accessed by a role.
- `CommandPermissions` defines which commands are allowed to be executed by a role.

## Type output permissions {#type-output-permissions}

A type output permission will need the type and the role(s) for which the permission should be defined. For each role,
you will need to define the fields accessible for that role.

### Metadata Structure

```yaml
kind: TypeOutputPermissions
typeName: <TypeName>
permissions: <OutputPermission>
```

| Field         | Type                                          | Required | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `typeName`    | [`TypeName`](/data-domain-modeling/types.mdx) | true     | Name of the output type on which permissions are to be defined.                                                                |
| `permissions` | [`OutputPermission`](#outputpermission)       | true     | The permissions object for this type. Each key of the object is a role, and the value is an object of type `OutputPermission`. |

#### OutputPermission

```yaml
<RoleName>:
  fields:
    - <field1>
    - <field2>
```

| Field      | Type       | Required | Description                                                        |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `RoleName` | `String`   | true     | The name of the role on which you're creating permissions.         |
| `fields`   | `[String]` | true     | List of field names (of the type) that are accessible to the role. |

### Examples

To define permissions on an output type `article` for `admin` and `user` role:

```yaml
kind: TypeOutputPermissions
typeName: article
permissions:
  admin:
    fields:
      - id
      - title
      - author_id
  user:
    fields:
      - id
      - title
```

:::info Types are inaccessible when undefined for a role

If a role doesn't define any permissions for this type, then it won't be accessible to that role.

:::

## Model Select Permissions {#model-select-permissions}

A model select permission will need the model name and the role(s) for which the permission should be defined. For each
role, you will need to define an optional filter expression. Objects (or rows/documents) that satisfy this filter
predicate will be returned for that role.

### Metadata Structure

```yaml
kind: ModelSelectPermissions
modelName: <ModelName>
permissions:
  <RoleName>:
    filter: <ModelPredicate>
  <RoleName>:
    filter: <ModelPredicate>
```

| Field       | Type                               | Required | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| modelName   | `String`                           | true     | Name of the model on which permissions are to be defined.                                                                      |
| permissions | `{<RoleName>: <SelectPermission>}` | true     | The permissions object for this type. Each key of the object is a role, and the value is an object of type `SelectPermission`. |

Note: `RoleName` is the role in `String`.

#### SelectPermission

| Field  | Type             | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| filter | `ModelPredicate` | false    | Optional predicate to satisfy. This predicate can use operators supported by the modelâ€™s data source. If the filter is missing then all rows are returned. If the filter is present, then only the rows satisfying this filter expression are returned. (Reference of [ModelPredicate](./common-syntax.mdx#modelpredicate)) |

### Examples

Below, we're creating a set of `ModelSelectPermissions` on the `Articles` model for the roles `admin`, `user_1`, and
`user_2.

As the `admin` object is empty, it will return all rows. The `user_1` object has a filter predicate that will return
rows where the `author_id` field is equal to the `x-hasura-user-id` session variable. The `user_2` object has a filter
predicate that will return rows where the `title` field is like the string `Functional`.

```yaml
---
kind: ModelSelectPermissions
modelName: Articles
permissions:
  admin: {}
  user_1:
    filter:
      fieldComparison:
        field: author_id
        operator: _eq
        value:
          sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
  user_2:
    filter:
      and:
        - fieldComparison:
            field: title
            operator: like
            value:
              literal: Functional
```

## Command permissions {#command-permissions}

A command permission will need the command name and the role(s) for which the permission should be defined.

### Metadata structure

```yaml
kind: CommandPermissions
commandName: <CommandName>
permissions:
  <RoleName>:
    allowExecution: <Boolean>
```

| Field         | Type                                | Required | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `commandName` | `String`                            | true     | Name of the command for which permissions are to be defined.                                                                       |
| `permissions` | `{<RoleName>: <CommandPermission>}` | true     | The permissions object for this command. Each key of the object is a role, and the value is an object of type `CommandPermission`. |

Note: `RoleName` is the role in `String`.

#### CommandPermission

| Field           | Type      | Required | Description                                          |
| --------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| allow_execution | `Boolean` | true     | Is the execution of the command allowed for the role |

### Examples

To define permissions on a command with name `get_article_by_id` for `admin` and `user` role:

```yaml
kind: CommandPermissions
commandName: get_latest_article_id
permissions:
  admin:
    allowExecution: true
  user:
    allowExecution: false
```

If a role doesn't define any permissions for this type, then it won't be accessible to that role.
