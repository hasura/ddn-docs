# Introduction

If you've used Hasura before, you'll notice that the Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD spec) is similar to
Hasura v2 metadata, but with many extra capabilities.

The new Hasura DDN tooling has built-in capabilities to autogenerate the OpenDD spec metadata from your existing data
via the GUI console or CLI terminal commands, or you can also author the your metadata manually.

## How is it different from Hasura v2 metadata?

- Hasura V2 metadata was specifically designed for Hasura, whereas the OpenDD spec is a specification that can also be
  used outside Hasura as a source of truth for your data domain.
- Functionally, the V2 metadata relied on the data source for information like columns and fields, whereas OpenDD
  metadata is independent of the data source. In OpenDD, all fields and types are defined within the specification
  itself which eliminates the necessity for data source schema introspection at startup to generate a GraphQL schema.
  Instead, data source introspection occurs as part of the metadata build process.
- In v2, metadata was stored as a JSON blob in a database, in Hasura DDN, after OpenDD metadata is built, it is a binary
  file that is applied to the Hasura project.

## The OpenDD spec

You can specify and combine data types, data models, relationships, permissions, and more in OpenDD metadata in
order to define your data domain.

In this way, your data domain specification is decoupled from underlying database, data source or any other physical
layer of storage.

This is powerful in that it allows you to continue to serve data in the same shape and with same authorization rules
even if, for instance, the underlying source is changed, perhaps if migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL, or if
switching to a polyglot data setup using Mongo for reads and MySQL for writes.


## Automatic metadata generation

These docs pages will help you understand how OpenDD Metadata is structured and the semantics of the
definition. However, you will also be able to generate your metadata automatically using the Hasura Console and LSP.


The OpenDD spec describes an array of OpenDD objects, consisting of the following kinds:

```json
{
  "metadata": [
    {"kind": "DataSource", ...},
    {"kind": "HasuraHubDataSource", ...},
    {"kind": "DataConnectorScalarRepresentation", ...},
    {"kind": "AuthConfig", ...},
    {"kind": "ScalarType", ...},
    {"kind": "ObjectType", ...},
    {"kind": "Model", ...},
    {"kind": "Relationship", ...},
    {"kind": "Command", ...},
    {"kind": "ModelSelectPermissions", ...},
    {"kind": "TypeOutputPermissions", ...},
  ]
}
```
