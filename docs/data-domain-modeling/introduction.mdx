# Introduction

If you've used Hasura before, you'll notice that the Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD spec) is similar to
Hasura v2 metadata, but with many extra capabilities.

The OpenDD metadata defines a space of what data types and features are available, where it resides, how it's related,
how to access it, and who has authority to access it. Metadata is combined with Native Data Connector agents,
which are services to communicate with data sources in order to deliver your API.

The new Hasura DDN tooling of Console and the
[VS Code LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) have built-in capabilities to
autogenerate the OpenDD spec metadata from your existing data via the GUI console or CLI terminal commands.
Alternatively, you can also author metadata manually.

## How is this different from Hasura v2 metadata?

- Hasura V2 metadata was specifically designed for Hasura, whereas OpenDD is a specification that can also be
  used outside Hasura by anyone as a source of truth for any data domain.
- Functionally, the V2 metadata relied directly on the data source for information like columns and fields, whereas
  OpenDD metadata is independent of the data source. In OpenDD, all fields and types are defined within the
  specification itself which eliminates the necessity for data source schema introspection at startup to generate a
  GraphQL schema. Instead, data source introspection occurs as part of the metadata build process.
- In v2, metadata was stored as a JSON blob in a database, in Hasura DDN, after OpenDD metadata is built, it is a binary
  file that is accessed by the Hasura project.

## The OpenDD spec

You can specify and combine data sources, data types, models, relationships, permissions, and more in your OpenDD
metadata in order to define your data domain.

In this way, your data domain specification is decoupled from any underlying database, data source or other physical
layer of storage.

This is powerful as it enables you to consistently deliver data with the same structure and authorization protocols.
This consistency remains intact even when you make significant changes, such as transitioning from MySQL to PostgreSQL,
adopting MongoDB for read operations and MySQL for write operations, altering your transactional email system, or
switching payment providers.

## Automatic metadata generation

These docs pages will help you understand how OpenDD Metadata is structured and the semantics of the
definition. However, you will also be able to generate your metadata automatically using the Hasura Console and LSP.

## OpenDD Spec Structure

The OpenDD spec describes an array of OpenDD objects, consisting of the following kinds:

```json
{
  "metadata": [
    {"kind": "HasuraHubDataSource", ...},
    {"kind": "DataSource", ...},
    {"kind": "AuthConfig", ...},
    {"kind": "ScalarType", ...},
    {"kind": "ObjectType", ...},
    {"kind": "DataConnectorScalarRepresentation", ...},
    {"kind": "Model", ...},
    {"kind": "Relationship", ...},
    {"kind": "Command", ...},
    {"kind": "ModelSelectPermissions", ...},
    {"kind": "TypeOutputPermissions", ...},
    {"kind": "CommandPermissions", ...},
  ]
}
```

[Primitives and container types](./types.mdx#primitive-and-container-types) are also defined at the
top level along with these metadata objects.

## Data Sources

The data source will define where the data is coming from. It can be a database, a REST API, a GraphQL API, etc. The
data source will use a [Native Data Connector](/connectors/overview.mdx) to connect to the data source and fetch the
data.

### The HasuraHubDataSource object

The [`HasuraHubDataSource`](./data-source.mdx) object allows you to specify a data source directly
from the [Hasura Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors/).

### The DataSource object

The [`DataSource`](./data-source.mdx) object describes a physical data source.

## Types

Types are a fundamental building block of OpenDD metadata with every bit of data in Open DDS having a type

### The objectType object

The [`ObjectType`](./types.mdx#object-types) object allows you to create completely new types.

#### The ScalarType object

The [`ScalarType`](./types.mdx#scalar-types) object allows aliasing other types.

#### The DataConnectorScalarRepresentation object

The [`DataConnectorScalarRepresentation`](./types.mdx#scalar-type-representation) object allows
you to define how a scalar type from a data source is represented as an OpenDD type.

## Models

Models are the link between your data sources and the API Hasura generates. A model may be backed by a database table,
an ad-hoc SQL query, a pre-materialized view, a custom REST or GraphQL API server, etc.

### The Model object

The [`Model`](./models.mdx) object represents a collection of data objects (like rows in a SQL table
or documents in collection in a NoSQL database) of a certain [type](./types.mdx). A Model type also defines how the
model and its types or fields map to entities in the underlying data source. It also defines how it is represented in
the GraphQL API.

## Commands

Commands are the other way of accessing data within the OpenDD spec. Commands are functions / procedures whose
implementations are unknown to the spec except for their input arguments and output type.

### The Command object

The [Command](./commands.mdx) object defines the name of the command, the arguments to the
command and the output type of the command.

## Relationships

Relationships allow you extend [type](./types.mdx) objects with related [models](./models.mdx) which then allows you
to query nested or linked information.

### The Relationship object

The [`Relationship`](./relationships.mdx) object defines a relationship between a source
[type](./types.mdx) and a target [models](./models.mdx).

## Permissions

The OpenDD Spec lets you define permissions, (also known as access control or authorization rules) on
[output types](./types.mdx), [models](./models.mdx) and [commands](./commands.mdx).

### The typeOutputPermissions object

[`TypeOutputPermissions`](./permissions.mdx#type-output-permissions) define which fields are allowed to be accessed
by a role. Defining permissions on output types is useful, as multiple models can return the same output type.

### The modelSelectPermissions object

[`ModelSelectPermissions`](./permissions.mdx#model-select-permissions) define which objects or rows within the model
are allowed to be accessed by a role.

### The commandPermissions object

[`CommandPermissions`](./permissions.mdx#command-permissions) define which commands are allowed to be accessed by a role.
