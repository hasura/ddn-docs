# Hasura GraphQL Data Domain Modeling Overview

Hasura now uses the Open Data Domain Specification (Open DD Spec) as the foundation for constructing your GraphQL API.
This specification serves as the definitive reference for your application's data infrastructure. It offers a
declarative approach for structuring your data and establishing API guidelines. Despite its comprehensive nature, it is
designed to be easy to read and write.
