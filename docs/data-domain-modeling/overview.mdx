# Hasura GraphQL Data Domain Modeling Overview

Hasura DDN uses the Open Data Domain Specification (Open DD Spec) as the foundation for describing your
data domain metadata and in turn generating your API.

This metadata specification serves as the definitive reference for your application's data infrastructure. It offers a
declarative approach for structuring your data and establishing your API.

Despite its comprehensive nature, it is designed to be easy to read and write.

## Data Sources

The data source will define where the data is coming from. It can be a database, a REST API, a GraphQL API, etc. The
data source will use a Native Data Connector to connect to the data source and fetch the data.

#### The HasuraHubDataSource object

The [`HasuraHubDataSource`](/data-domain-modeling/data-source.mdx) object allows you to specify a data source directly
from the [Hasura Hub](https://hasura.io/hub/).

#### The DataSource object

The [`DataSource`](/data-domain-modeling/data-source.mdx) object describes a physical data source.

## Types

Types are a fundamental building block of Open DDS with every bit of data in Open DDS having a type

### The objectType object

The `ObjectType` object allows you to create completely new types.

#### The ScalarType object

The [`ScalarType`](/data-domain-modeling/types.mdx) object allows aliasing other types.

#### The DataConnectorScalarRepresentation object

The [`DataConnectorScalarRepresentation`](/data-domain-modeling/types.mdx) object allows you to define how a scalar
type from a data source is represented as an OpenDD type.

[//]: # (#### The NewType object)
[//]: # (The [`NewType`]&#40;/data-domain-modeling/types.mdx&#41; object allow you to alias types.)

## Models

Models are the primary way of defining data in Hasura DDN and a model would in reality be backed by a database table, an
ad-hoc SQL query, a pre-materialized view, a custom REST or GraphQL API server, etc.

### The Model object

The [`Model`](/data-domain-modeling/models.mdx) object represents a collection of data objects (like rows in a SQL table
or documents in collection in a NoSQL database) of a certain [type](./types.mdx). A Model type also defines how the
model and its types or fields map to entities in the underlying data source. It also defines how it is represented in
the GraphQL API.

## Commands

Commands are the other way of accessing data within the OpenDD spec. Commands are functions / lambdas whose semantics
are opaque to the spec except for their input arguments and output type.

### The command object

The command object defines the name of the command, the arguments to the command and the output type of the command.

### The commandSource object

Similar to `modelSource`, the `commandSource` object defines how the types which the command uses map to an
underlying data source.

## Relationships

Relationships define that given an object of a certain type, how to find related objects in a model or command

### The Relationship object

relationship defined in the Open DD spec allows you extend [type](./types.mdx) objects with related
[models](./models.mdx) which then allows you to query nested or linked information.

To create a relationship, you will need to define an object with `"kind": "relationship"`.

## Permissions

The OpenDD Spec lets you define permissions, (also known as access control or authorization rules) on
[models](./models.mdx) and [output types](./types.mdx) in your data domain.

### The typeOutputPermissions object

`typeOutputPermissions` define which fields are allowed to be accessed by a role. Defining permissions on output types
is useful, as multiple models can return the same output type.

### The modelSelectPermissions object

`modelSelectPermissions` define which objects or rows within the model are allowed to be accessed by a role.

## GraphQL API

With the generated API, you can query, insert, update and delete data in your data domain. (Only query APIs are
available in the current release.) The benefit of defining the GraphQL API in the OpenDD Spec format is that you can
fully customize it to your needs.

To enable the GraphQL API in Hasura DDN, the following OpenDD spec metadata objects need to be defined:

- [modelGraphqlApi](#model-graphql-api):
- [scalarTypeGraphqlExpression](#scalar-type-graphql-expression):

### The graphqlType object

[//]: # (TODO: Add description)

### The modelGraphqlApi object

The root fields for a [model](./models.mdx) which are exposed over the GraphQL API.

### The commandGraphqlApi object

[//]: # (TODO: Add description)

### The scalarTypeGraphqlExpression object

[Type](./types.mdx) names in the schema which are generated for data source scalars.
