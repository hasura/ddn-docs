# Hasura GraphQL Data Domain Modeling Overview

Hasura now uses the Open Data Domain Specification (Open DD Spec) as the foundation for constructing your GraphQL API.
This specification serves as the definitive reference for your application's data infrastructure. It offers a
declarative approach for structuring your data and establishing API guidelines. Despite its comprehensive nature, it is
designed to be easy to read and write.

If you have used Hasura before, you will notice that the Open DD Spec is similar to the Hasura v2 metadata but with more
configurations and capabalities.

The new Hasura console and CLI has built in capabilities to autogenerate the Open DD Spec Metadata from your existing
data with GUI and commands. You can also write the spec manually and use the CLI to create builds and then apply
metadata builds to your Hasura projects.

### How is it different from Hasura v2 metadata

- V2 metadata was specifically designed for Hasura, whereas Open DDS is a specification that can be used to model your
  data domain and can also be used outside Hasura as a source of truth for your data domain.
- Functionally, the V2 metadata relied on the datasource to get some informations like columns and fields, whereas Open
  DDS metadata is independent of the datasource. In Open DDS, all fields and types are defined within the specification
  itself, eliminating the necessity for datasource schema introspection at startup to generate a GraphQL schema.
  Instead, data source introspection occurs as part of the metadata build process.
- In v2, the metadata was stored in a database, but the OpenDDS Metadata is a build is a binary file that is built from
  the metadata and then applied to the Hasura project.
