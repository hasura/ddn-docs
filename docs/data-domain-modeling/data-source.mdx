# Hasura Data Domain Specification Data Source

## Introduction

A Data Source is a way to specify where your data comes from and how it can be used. It can connect to various types of
data, like SQL databases, NoSQL databases, REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, files, and more.

A Data Source includes two main things: a connector URL (the link to your data) and the schema that it understands.

In the Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD Spec), every DataSource must have a connector URL and a schema. This
schema defines how the data is structured and what all operations can be performed on the data.

Once you've declared a Data Source, you can use it in your `Model`'s configuration by
[referencing it with the source](../models/#source) property, connecting your model to your chosen data source.

## Description

To create a data source, start by defining an OpenDD object with the "kind" set to "DataSource". This object should also include
three fields: `name`, `data_connector_url`, and `schema`.

```json
{
  "kind": "DataSource",
  "name": "<DataSourceName>",
  "data_connector_url": "<DataConnectorURL>",
  "schema": "<SchemaResponse>"
}
```

| Field              | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name               | `String` | true     | Name of the Data Source.                                                                                               |
| data_connector_url | `String` | true     | URL to access the data source connector.                                                                               |
| schema             | `Object` | true     | The schema response from the data connector- includes scalar_types, object_type, collections, functions and procedures |

## Schema

Schema is an object that defines the types, schema, functions, etc of the data source. 
This is usually received from the `/schema` endpoint of the data connector. It has the following fields:

```json
{
  "scalar_types": "<ScalarTypes>",
  "object_types": "<ObjectTypes>",
  "collections": "<Collections>",
  "functions": "<Functions>",
  "procedures": "<Procedures>"
}
```

| Field        | Type     | Required | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| scalar_types | `Object` | true     | Supported scalar types, with definitions for aggregate functions and more. |
| object_types | `Object` | true     | Supported object types with their definitions.                             |
| collections  | `Array`  | true     | Collections in the schema.                                                 |
| functions    | `Array`  | true     | Functions in the schema.                                                   |
| procedures   | `Array`  | true     | Procedures in the schema.                                                  |
