## Prerequisites

**Install the DDN CLI**

:::info Minimum version requirements

To use this guide, ensure you've installed/updated your CLI to at least `v2.28.0`.

:::

<InstallTheCli />

**Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)**

The Docker-based workflow helps you iterate and develop locally without deploying any changes to Hasura DDN, making the
development experience faster and your feedback loops shorter. **You'll need Docker Compose `v2.20` or later.**

**Validate the installation**

You can verify that the DDN CLI is installed correctly by running:

```ddn
ddn doctor
```
