# Upgrade Guide

## Introduction

Currently, there is no in-place upgrade path from Hasura v2 to Hasura DDN. You can follow the
[Strangler Fig pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/strangler-fig) to migrate your
existing Hasura v2 applications to Hasura DDN. This pattern involves creating a new Hasura DDN project and migrating
your existing Hasura v2 application to it incrementally. Then, you can decommission your Hasura v2 project once the
migration is complete.

**We'd like to remind you as well that Hasura v2 is still supported and will be maintained according to our
[LTS policy](https://hasura.io/docs/2.0/policies/versioning/).**

## Migration

When upgrading from Hasura v2 to Hasura DDN, you have two primary approaches to ensure a smooth transition while
maintaining service continuity for your existing API clients. Depending on your needs, you can either introduce the DDN
API as a completely separate endpoint or gradually phase out the v2 API by marking fields as deprecated. Below are the
details of each approach:

### Parallel deployment

**Introduce DDN as a new API alongside your existing v2 API.**

- Create a new Hasura DDN project and configure it to provide the same or extended functionalities as your existing
  Hasura v2 setup.
- Deploy the DDN project and make it available via its own endpoint.
- Update your documentation and notify your team or clients about the new API endpoint. Allow them to transition to the
  DDN API at their own pace.
- Continue maintaining the Hasura v2 API alongside DDN, ensuring that any new features or updates are made to the DDN
  project.
- Once all consumers have transitioned to the DDN API, you can decommission the Hasura v2 project.

### Phased deprecation

**Gradually transition to DDN using GraphQL deprecated flags.**

- Start by creating a new Hasura DDN project that mirrors your existing Hasura v2 schema and functionalities.
- Gradually introduce new features or improvements through the DDN API, marking equivalent fields, types, or queries in
  the v2 API as deprecated using GraphQL's deprecation mechanism.
- Communicate these deprecations clearly to your API consumers, providing them with documentation and timelines for when
  the deprecated features will be removed.
- Monitor the usage of deprecated features and work closely with API consumers to ensure a smooth transition to the DDN
  API.
- As more consumers adopt the DDN API, reduce the reliance on the Hasura v2 API until it can be safely decommissioned.

With either of these strategies, you'll need a clear understanding of features and functionalities that need to be
migrated. Check out [this page](/upgrade/feature-availability/index.mdx) for a detailed comparison of the features
available between Hasura v2 and Hasura DDN, and a guide on how to migrate them.
