# Upgrade to Hasura DDN

## Introduction

The Hasura Data Delivery Network presents a new way to build applications with Hasura. This section of documentation
will help you understand the similarities and differences between the older versions of Hasura and Hasura DDN, guide you
through the upgrade process, and provide you with resources to aid in migrating your existing applications to Hasura
DDN.

## Why upgrade?

Hasura DDN delivers a wealth of features that will help you build applications faster and more efficiently. You can
explore our documentation to get a better sense of what Hasura DDN has to offer.

### Individual developers

As an **individual developer working on a small or hobby project**, you can use Hasura DDN for free. That's right: free!
We'll host your API for you at no cost, forever.

**Before:**

- Limited by Hasura v2's metadata model that was tightly coupled with PostgreSQL and GraphQL, making it hard to think of
  it as a general-purpose API platform.
- Struggled with the complexities of managing server infrastructure or paying for hosted services (yep, even Hasura
  Cloud).
- Worried about the long-term costs and scalability of your project.

**After:**

- Server infrastructure worries are a thing of the past — [Hasura DDN takes care of hosting](https://hasura.io/pricing)
  for free.
- You can fully concentrate on building your product, with backend infrastructure handled.
- Enjoy peace of mind knowing that your project can grow without added costs.

### Small teams

As a **small team**, you can leverage Hasura DDN to streamline your development process and reduce overhead. With Hasura
DDN, your team can quickly prototype and iterate on features using immutable builds, ensuring that deployments are
consistent and reliable. This means more time to focus on delivering value to your customers and less time spent
debugging.

**Before:**

- Hasura v2's build and runtime coupling led to performance issues, slowing down your deployment processes.
- No ability to preview the API, publish or rollback quickly.
- Lack of clarity on subgraph changes for your published API and long feedback loops due to the inability to test during
  local development.

**After:**

- Speed up your workflow with [immutable builds](/project-configuration/builds.mdx) that make rapid prototyping a
  breeze.
- Ensure smooth and dependable [deployments](/getting-started/deployment/index.mdx), cutting down on debugging time.
- Simplify your development lifecycle with [declarative metadata](/supergraph-modeling/overview.mdx) that defines your
  API structure.

### Mature teams

For **mature teams in large organizations**, Hasura DDN transforms your approach to scaling and integrating
applications. With built-in federation using subgraphs and Hasura's metadata-driven data access layer, you can grow your
application as your business expands, seamlessly adding new data sources and services without extensive rewrites. These
two pillars of value—federation and metadata—further streamline your architecture, providing a unified and scalable way
to manage your API across multiple environments.

**Before:**

- Hasura v2’s monolithic metadata made it challenging for multiple teams to collaborate, leading to inefficiencies and
  slower development cycles.
- Integration of new data sources and services required extensive rewrites.
- Managing APIs across various environments was complex and time-consuming.

**After:**

- Easily scale with [built-in federation](/getting-started/collaborate/federation.mdx) that integrates subgraphs into
  your Hasura DDN setup.
- Add [new data sources](/connectors/overview.mdx) seamlessly, avoiding the need for major overhauls.
- Manage your API effortlessly across different environments with the world's first
  [declarative metadata access layer](/supergraph-modeling/overview.mdx) that unifies control.
