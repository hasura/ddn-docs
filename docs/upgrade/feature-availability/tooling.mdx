# Tooling

## Introduction

We've built Hasura DDN from the ground up for scale, both in terms of performance and the ease with which teams can
collaborate on any given API. Hasura DDN introduces several improvements to enhance the development experience,
particularly in areas where collaboration and large-scale management are critical.

| Feature             | v2      | DDN |
| ------------------- | ------- | --- |
| The Hasura console  | ✅      | ✅  |
| The Hasura CLI      | ✅      | ✅  |

**\*EE**: Available on Cloud and Enterprise editions only.

## Features

### The Hasura console

In Hasura v2, the console played a central role as the primary interface for authoring and editing your GraphQL API and
the underlying data sources. The console provided a user-friendly graphical interface for various tasks, making it
easier to configure and interact with your Hasura instance without needing to write complex code or commands.

**In Hasura DDN, the console serves primarily as an exploration and management tool**. It allows you to visualize,
explore, test, and deploy your API. Unlike in v2, the console in Hasura DDN is not used to author or edit your API.
However, we've expanded the console's features to include granular analytics and the ability to add collaborators with
read-only status. This makes it easy to share and onboard an API quickly and efficiently.

### The Hasura CLI

In Hasura v2, the CLI was used for various tasks such as managing metadata, applying migrations, and working with
environment configurations. It provided a command-line interface to automate and script these operations, making it
easier to integrate Hasura into CI/CD pipelines.

**In Hasura DDN, the CLI becomes your primary tool for constructing an API**. It is used for creating local and cloud
projects, scaffolding out metadata, and creating iterative, immutable builds of your API. Additionally, the CLI helps
streamline deployment processes and allows for easy automation, maintaining the functionality of managing and
configuring your API from the command line.

The CLI also facilitates declarative work with Hasura metadata in conjunction with
[Hasura's VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura), which provides
auto-complete and error hinting. The new metadata folder and file structure enhances your ability to reason and navigate
your metadata intuitively.

The CLI is at the center of it all, interacting with key components to help you iterate faster. Check out the
[new command structure here](/reference/cli/index.mdx) or
[learn how to create your first project here](/quickstart.mdx).

### IDE Integrations

In Hasura v2, IDE integrations were not available, making it difficult to work with Hasura metadata and configuration
files in your favorite code editor.

**In Hasura DDN, we've introduced IDE integrations** to make it easier to work with Hasura metadata and author your API,
all from within your editor. Currently, we support
[VS Code via an extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura), with plans to expand to
other editors in the future.

### Database Migrations

In Hasura v2, database migrations were supported through the Hasura CLI, allowing you to manage changes to your database
schema and metadata.

**In Hasura DDN, database migrations are not supported**. However, there are a variety of excellent free alternatives
available, such as [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/), [DbMate](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate), and
[Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/), that can be used in conjunction with Hasura DDN to manage your database schema
changes. Check back soon where we'll have dedicated guides for using these tools in conjunction with CI/CD for your
projects.

### Prometheus

In Hasura v2, the Prometheus integration was available only on Cloud and Enterprise Editions for monitoring and alerting
based on API metrics.

**In Hasura DDN, the Prometheus exporter is natively supported** and free to use with both the Hasura engine and with
data connectors.

### OpenTelemetry

In Hasura v2, OpenTelemetry was available only on Cloud and Enterprise editions (denoted by (EE)) for distributed
tracing and observability.

**In Hasura DDN, much like Prometheus, OpenTelemetry is natively supported** and free to use with both the Hasura engine
and with data connectors.
