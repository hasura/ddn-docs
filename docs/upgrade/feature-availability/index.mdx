# Feature Availability

## Introduction

We're constantly rolling out updates to Hasura DDN to provide you with new features and improvements. This page will
help you understand the differences between Hasura v2 and Hasura DDN, so you can make an informed decision about
upgrading.

We've broken parity down into two categories:

- [API features](/upgrade/feature-availability/api-features.mdx)
- [Tooling](/upgrade/feature-availability/tooling.mdx)
