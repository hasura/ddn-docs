# Service Accounts

## Introduction

Project administrators can create and delete service accounts as needed. These accounts can act as collaborators on other projects, just like regular users, and can hold roles such as supergraph admin or subgraph admin. Additionally, project administrators can regenerate access tokens for service accounts, making them a secure and ideal alternative to Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for use in CI/CD workflows.

:::info Only available on DDN Base and higher

In order to create service accounts, your project must either be a
[DDN Base or DDN Advanced project](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).
