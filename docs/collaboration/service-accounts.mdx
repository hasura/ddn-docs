# Service Accounts

## Introduction

Service accounts are essentially dummy user accounts that project owners or administrators can create and delete as needed. They can function as collaborators on other projects, similar to regular users, and can hold roles such as Supergraph Admin or Subgraph Admin. Additionally, users have the ability to regenerate access tokens for service accounts, making them an ideal and secure alternative to Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for use in CI/CD workflows.

:::info Only available on DDN Base and higher

In order to create service accounts, your project must either be a
[DDN Base or DDN Advanced project](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).
