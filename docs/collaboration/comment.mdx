# Commenting on Metadata

## Introduction

Hasura DDN provides a commenting feature that allows your API producers and consumers to start conversations directly on
the API metadata. This feature enhances collaboration by closing the feedback loop and helps teams communicate more
effectively about their API design and implementation.

:::tip Getting Access

This feature is currently in limited access and only available for Hasura Cloud projects. To get access, please fill out
this [form](https://forms.gle/tudE2jzD7get5iJF7).

## How to comment

You can add comments on various objects from your metadata.

1. Navigate to any model page in your project via the `Explorer` tab.
2. Hover over the field or section you want to comment on.
3. Click on the comment icon that appears.

## Notifications

To ensure effective collaboration, you can tag subgraph collaborators in your comments:

1. Type `@` in your comment.
2. Select the collaborator you want to notify.

Tagged collaborators will receive an email with your comments and a notification on the notification hub on the console,
keeping them informed of any discussions or questions.

The notification hub can be found in the top right corner of the console. On clicking the comments button, you will see
all the comments where you are tagged in one place. The messages will be grouped based on the underlying commenting
thread. You can click on a particular comment (deep linking) and go to the original thread on the console. You can also
delete notifications from that menu.
