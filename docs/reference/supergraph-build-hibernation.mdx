# Supergraph Build Hibernation

## Overview

Supergraph builds that remain unapplied and idle are automatically hibernated to conserve resources. Specifically:

- Any unapplied build that is older than two days **and** has not received a request in the last two days is hibernated.
- Hibernation pauses execution but preserves metadata and other build inputs so you can reactivate the build if needed.

Once hibernated, a build must be explicitly reactivated before it can start
serving traffic again. Until then, all requests will fail with 409 status code.

## Reactivation

You can bring a hibernated build back online through either the DDN CLI or the console.

### Reactivate via CLI

Run the `ddn supergraph build reactivate` command to reactivate the hibernated assets. Reference the full command options in the CLI docs:

- [ddn supergraph build reactivate](/reference/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_reactivate.mdx)

### Reactivate via console

1. Open your project on the Hasura console and navigate to the **Builds** page.
2. Locate the hibernated build and select **Reactivate**. Confirm the action to immediately queue a rebuild and resume the associated API endpoint.
