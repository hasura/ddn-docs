# Databricks

## Introduction

Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for Databricks, providing integration with Databricks warehouses. This
connector allows you to leverage Databricks' powerful OLAP capabilities while taking advantage of Hasura’s
metadata-driven approach. Here, we’ll explore the key features of the Databricks connector and walk through the
configuration process within a Hasura DDN project.
