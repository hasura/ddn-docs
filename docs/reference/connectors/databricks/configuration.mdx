# Configuration Reference

## Introduction

The configuration is a metadata object that describes the schema of your Databricks workspace, including tables,
columns, and the connection details. This configuration is static â€” changes in your Databricks schema will require
updating and reapplying the configuration file. See [updating with introspection](#updating-with-introspection) for more
details.

## Structure

The configuration object is a JSON object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "connection_uri": {
    "variable": "JDBC_URL"
  },
  "tables": [],
  "primary_keys": [],
  "foreign_keys": {}
}
```

### Property: connection_uri

This field defines the environment variable that contains the JDBC connection URI to connect to your Databricks
instance.

### Property: tables

This is an array of table definitions that describe the structure of the available data in your Databricks workspace.

Each table includes:

- Fully-qualified name (including schema and catalog)
- List of columns and their types
- Primary key and foreign key metadata (if available)

## Updating with introspection

If your Databricks schema changes, you should re-introspect to update the configuration accordingly.

Running `update` in a configuration directory will:

- Connect to the Databricks workspace using the `JDBC_URL`
- Scan available tables and columns
- Generate an updated configuration file reflecting the current schema
