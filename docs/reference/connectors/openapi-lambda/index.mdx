# OpenAPI Lambda

## Introduction

The Hasura OpenAPI connector allows you to seamlessly integrate HTTP APIs defined in OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)
specifications into your Hasura GraphQL API. This connector works by:

1. Reading your OpenAPI Document (either from a URL or local file)
2. Generating TypeScript code that represents your API endpoints and types
3. Converting these HTTP endpoints into GraphQL queries and mutations
4. Exposing them through Hasura's DDN's GraphQL API
