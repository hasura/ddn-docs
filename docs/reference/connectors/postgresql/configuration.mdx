# Configuration Reference, Version 5

:::info

Supported since data connector version `v1.0.0`

:::

The format of the configuration data varies between versions. When a connector subgraph is added to a project, a
`schema.json` file is created in the configuration directory which describes the format of the `configuration.json`
file.

## Introduction

The configuration is a metadata object that lists all the database entities — such as tables — that the data connector
has to know about in order to serve queries. It never changes during the lifetime of the data connector service
instance. When your database schema changes you will have to update the configuration accordingly, see
[updating with introspection](#updating-with-introspection).

Below you will find information about how to work effectively with the configuration authoring tools provided by Hasura,
along with the data connector and descriptions of the meanings of each configuration field.

## Versioning policy

The PostgreSQL data connector and its configuration format are versioned independently.

**The data connector will always support at least the latest two configuration versions**, and tooling is provided to
ease the upgrade of configurations. A Hasura DDN project will always use the `head` version of the PostgreSQL data
connector. We recommend doing the same for data connector instances used for local development as well.

During its lifetime, the `head` version of the configuration format may receive backwards-compatible extensions. The
reference documentation of the configuration version will always list the version of the connector which introduced the
configuration extension. The configuration version number is only bumped when it changes in a way that is not backwards
compatible.

Certain fields have default values. The defaults are allowed to evolve over time without requiring a version bump.
Whenever you initialize a new project or update an existing one, all unspecified fields will have their defaults output,
ensuring that only intentional updates to default fields will ever affect the observable behavior of a project, save for
enhancements to performance and security.

The currently supported versions are:

- `"version": "5"` (current)
- `"version": "4"` (deprecated)
- `"version": "3"` (deprecated)

## Configuration workflows

The data connector provides a plugin to the hasura CLI to assist you in authoring configuration.

We provide the `ndc-postgres-cli`, which is a small executable, whose builds can be accessed
[here](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-postgres/releases/).

:::warning Current status

The intended way to commonly use this plugin is through the main `ddn` CLI.

Some of the commands, such as `initialize` and `update`, do not need to be invoked directly as part of the `ddn` CLI
workflow.

The commands can be invoked by changing the directory into the connector directory (e.g.
`cd my_subgraph/connector/my_pg/`) and invoking the command using the following syntax:

```sh
ddn connector plugin --connector connector.yaml -- --help
```

:::

### The initial configuration

Running `initialize` in an empty directory will produce a single file, `configuration.json`, containing a minimal
configuration which expects to be given a connection string via the environment variable `CONNECTION_URI`.

This is the same configuration you would get if you were to add a new PostgreSQL data connector to a project with the
`ddn` cli.

SSL configuration can be provided via the following variables, which can either be suppied via Hasura Cloud, or as
environment variable arguments to the binary or Docker container:

- `CLIENT_CERT`: the contents of the SSL client certificate.
- `CLIENT_KEY`: the contents of the SSL client key.
- `ROOT_CERT`: the contents of the SSL root certificate.

If your certificates are stored in files, these files can be read into environment variables. As an example, we could
read the client certificate into the environment variable like so:

```bash
CLIENT_CERT="$(cat client-certficate.pem)"
```

### Updating with introspection

Whenever the schema of your database changes you will need to update your data connector configuration accordingly to
reflect those changes.

Running `update` in a configuration directory will do the following:

- Connect to the database with the specified `connectionUri`, and then overwrite all data in the `metadata` field
  (except for the native operations) based on the contents of the database and the values given in the
  `introspectionOptions` field.

- Fill in default values for any fields absent from the configuration, as described in the
  [Versioning Policy](#versioning-policy) section.

Various fields in the `introspectionOptions` object influence the outcome of the introspection process, See
[Configure options](#manually-editing).

### Upgrading the configuration format version

The `ndc-postgres-cli` plugin can assist in upgrading any supported version of a connector configuration to the latest
one.

`upgrade --from-dir <existing configuration dir> --to-dir <new directory>` will produce an upgraded version of the
configuration in `<existing configuration dir>` and place it in `<new directory>`.

For example:

```sh
cd <connector-path> # E.g. my_subgraph/connector/my_pg/
ddn connector plugin --connector connector.yaml -- upgrade --dir-from . --dir-to .
```

Sometimes a configuration format upgrade will need some manual editing of the result, if the new version requires
information that cannot be derived from the previous version. This can vary from case to case, but the upgrade command
will output instructions if there are known manual changes required.

### Manually editing

There are occasions when the automatic introspection falls short of your needs. For instance, it may not detect a
particular entity type, or it may pick names according to conventions with which you disagree.

If you find yourself in this situation you may still be able to bring your configuration into an acceptable state by
editing it manually. In this case you'd be well advised to keep your configuration files under version control, as
re-running the `update` command will overwrite your manually-crafted changes.

If there is a pattern to the changes you find yourself applying manually it's possible that your use case could warrant
a new `introspectionOptions` field that could integrate the pattern with the normal introspection process. Feel free to
raise a feature request issue on the [Issue Tracker][Graphql-Engine Issue Tracker].

One section of the configuration that will always need manual authorship is the user-defined
[`nativeQueries`](/reference/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/index.mdx).

[Graphql-Engine Issue Tracker]: http://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues

## Changes from the previous version

Version 5 separates the `nativeQueries` into two fields, `queries` and `mutations`, and nests them under
`nativeOperations`, as well as nested `scalarTypes` and `compositeTypes` under `types` and renames them to `scalar` and
`composite` respectively.

## The initial configuration

Running `ndc-postgres-cli initialize` in an empty directory will produce a single file, `configuration.json`, reproduced
here in abbreviated form:

```yaml
{
  "version": "5",
  "$schema": "./schema.json",
  "connectionSettings":
    {
      "connectionUri": { "variable": "CONNECTION_URI" },
      "isolationLevel": "ReadCommitted",
      "poolSettings":
        {
          "maxConnections": 50,
          "poolTimeout": 30,
          "idleTimeout": 180,
          "connectionLifetime": 600,
          "checkConnectionAfterIdle": 60,
        },
    },
  "mutationsVersion": null,
  "metadata":
    {
      "tables": {},
      "nativeOperations": { "queries": {}, "mutations": {} },
      "types": { "scalar": {}, "composite": {} },
    },
  "introspectionOptions":
    {
      "excludedSchemas":
        ["information_schema", "pg_catalog", "tiger", "crdb_internal", "columnar", "columnar_internal"],
      "unqualifiedSchemasForTables": ["public"],
      "unqualifiedSchemasForTypesAndProcedures": ["public", "pg_catalog", "tiger"],
      "comparisonOperatorMapping":
        [
          { "operatorName": "=", "exposedName": "_eq", "operatorKind": "equal" },
          { "operatorName": "<=", "exposedName": "_lte", "operatorKind": "custom" },
          ...,
        ],
      "introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators": ["box_above", "box_below", ...],
      "typeRepresentations": { "bit": "string", "bool": "boolean", ... },
    },
}
```

The various default values of `introspectionOptions` fields are output explicitly. This provides both immediacy and
versioning flexibly.

Making defaults explicitly present means you don't have to look up in the reference documentation to know what
configuration is in force, and it allows the defaults to evolve over time without requiring a version bump of the
configuration format.

### A minimal configuration

The very minimal configuration that is acceptable elides all fields that have defaults and contains just the `version`
and `connectionUri` fields:

```yaml
{ "version": "5", "connectionSettings": { "connectionUri": { "value": "postgres://..." } } }
```

or, to get the connection uri from an environment variable:

```yaml
{ "version": "5", "connectionSettings": { "connectionUri": { "variable": "CONNECTION_URI" } } }
```

Note that the choice of environment variable name `CONNECTION_URI` is only a matter of convention. Any environment
variable can be used.

## `version`

This version uses the string-value `"5"`.

## `connectionSettings`

### `connectionUri`

The `connectionUri` field indicates the uri of the database which the connector will be querying. This can be given
either as a literal value, or sourced from an environment variable (to help with sound credentials storage for
instance).

The PostgreSQL database URL should follow the [PostgreSQL connection URI form][libpq: Connection Strings]

**Examples:**

```yaml
"connectionUri": "postgresql://user:password@host/databasename"
```

```yaml
"connectionUri": { "variable": "CONNECTION_URI" }
```

Note that the choice of environment variable name `CONNECTION_URI` is only a matter of convention. Any environment
variable can be used.

[libpq: Connection Strings]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING

### `poolSettings`

This field indicates how the data connector should manage connection pooling.

The default value is:

```yaml
"poolSettings":
  {
    "maxConnections": 50,          // Maximum number of pool connections
    "poolTimeout": 30,             // Maximum time to acquire a connection from the pool (seconds)
    "checkConnectionAfterIdle": 60 // Time at which an idle connection will be checked as still being alive (seconds / null)
    "idleTimeout": 180,            // Time at which an idle connection will be released from the pool (seconds)
    "connectionLifetime": 600,     // Maximum time for an individual connection (seconds)
  }
```

The `idleTimeout` and `connectionLifetime` options may be set to `null`. This indicates that connections will never be
retired from the pool. The `checkConnectionAfterIdle` option may also be set to `null`. This indicates that the
connection should be checked each time we acquire it from the pool.

Note the distinction between setting the fields to `null` versus omitting them. `null` indicates an indefinite value and
omission indicates the default value.

### `isolationLevel`

This field indicates the isolation level of the transaction in which a query is executed.

It may take on the following values:

- `ReadCommitted` (the default). Prevents reading data from another uncommitted transaction.
- `RepeatableRead`. Reading the same data twice is guaranteed to return the same result.
- `Serializable`. Concurrent transactions behave identically to serializing them one at a time.

## `metadata`

The metadata section collects declarations of all the database entities that are known to the data connector.

### `tables`

The `tables` field collects all the tables and views, and the collection name that will be used for each of them.

Consult the [json schema reference][Configuration JSON Schema] for details.

**Example**

```yaml
"tables":
  {
    "Album":
      {
        // Exposed collection name "schemaName": "public",
        "tableName": "Album",
        // The actual name of the table in the database "columns":
          {
            "AlbumId":
              {
                // The exposed field name "name": "AlbumId",
                // The actual name of the column in the table "type": { "scalarType": "int4" },
                "nullable": "nonNullable",
                "description": "The identifier of an album",
              },
            "ArtistId":
              {
                "name": "ArtistId",
                "type": { "scalarType": "int4" },
                "nullable": "nonNullable",
                "description": "The id of the artist that authored the album",
              },
            "Title":
              {
                "name": "Title",
                "type": { "scalarType": "varchar" },
                "nullable": "nonNullable",
                "description": "The title of an album",
              },
          },
        "uniquenessConstraints": { "PK_Album": ["AlbumId"] },
        "foreignRelations":
          {
            "FK_AlbumArtistId":
              {
                "foreignSchema": "public",
                "foreignTable": "Artist",
                "columnMapping": { "ArtistId": // Column of this table "ArtistId" // Column of the referenced table },
              },
          },
        "description": "The record of all albums",
      },
  }
```

#### The types of a column

Valid column types include all of scalar types, (single-dimension) array types, and composite types.

**Examples**

```yaml
"type": { "scalarType": "varchar" }
```

```yaml
"type": { "arrayType": { "scalarType": "varchar" } }
```

```yaml
"type": {
  "compositeType": "person_address"
},
```

```yaml
"type": { "arrayType": { "compositeType": "person_address" } }
```

### `nativeOperations`

The `queries` and `mutations` fields collect user-specified SQL queries that that may become either queryable
collections or mutations in the generated connector schema.

Each query is specified as SQL, and the types of any query arguments and result columns must be specified explicitly.

The following fields should be specified for a Native Operation entry:

- `sql`: SQL expression to use for the Native Operation. We can interpolate values using `{{variable_name}}` syntax,
  such as `SELECT * FROM authors WHERE name = {{author_name}}`. Can be specify either a path to file in the connector
  configuration directory with `{ "file": "<file>" }`, or an inline SQL query such as `{ "inline": "SELECT 1 as one" }`.
- `columns`: The returning columns from the Native Operation.
- `arguments`: Names and types of arguments that can be passed to this Native Operation.
- `description`: Information about the Native Operation.

**Example**

```json
"queries": {
  "artist_below_id": {
    "sql": {
      "inline": "SELECT * FROM public.\"Artist\" WHERE \"ArtistId\" < {{id}}"
    },
    "columns": {
      "ArtistId": {
        "name": "ArtistId",
        "type": {
          "scalarType": "int4"
        }
      },
      "Name": {
        "name": "Name",
        "type": {
          "scalarType": "varchar"
        }
      }
    },
    "arguments": {
      "id": {
        "name": "id",
        "type": {
          "scalarType": "int4"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the arguments are provided as query parameters - they are not textually interpolated into the query. As such,
a native query argument are value expressions and cannot be used in the place of e.g. a table name.

See also the main [Native Operations](/reference/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/) documentation.

### `types`

Information pertaining the database types used by the connector.

#### `types.composite`

The `composite` field collects information on all explicitly defined composite types (i.e., those that do not arise
implicitly from a table).

**Example**

Assuming your database has the following types defined:

```sql
CREATE TYPE person_name AS
  (
    first_name text,
    last_name text
  );

CREATE TYPE person_address AS
  (
    address_line_1 text,
    address_line_2 text
  );

CREATE TYPE person AS
  (
    name person_name,
    address person_address
  );
```

The introspection process will generate the corresponding metadata declarations:

```yaml
"composite":
  {
    "person":
      {
        "name": "person",
        "schema": "public",
        "fields":
          {
            "address": { "name": "address", "type": { "compositeType": "person_address" }, "description": null },
            "name": { "name": "name", "type": { "compositeType": "person_name" }, "description": null },
          },
        "description": null,
      },
    "person_address":
      {
        "name": "person_address",
        "schema": "public",
        "fields":
          {
            "address_line_1": { "name": "address_line_1", "type": { "scalarType": "text" }, "description": null },
            "address_line_2": { "name": "address_line_2", "type": { "scalarType": "text" }, "description": null },
          },
        "description": null,
      },
    "person_name":
      {
        "name": "person_name",
        "schema": "public",
        "fields":
          {
            "first_name": { "name": "first_name", "type": { "scalarType": "text" }, "description": null },
            "last_name": { "name": "last_name", "type": { "scalarType": "text" }, "description": null },
          },
        "description": null,
      },
  }
```

#### `types.scalar` {#scalartypes}

The `metadata.types.scalar` field captures the scalar types that end up appearing in the data connector schema and their
associated comparison operators and aggregation functions.

The introspection process will attempt to ensure that only relevant types that actually appear in collection fields or
input argument appear in the metadata.

**Example**

```yaml
"scalar":
  {
    "bool":
      {
        // The name that appears in the data connector schema "typeName": "bool",
        "schemaName": "pg_catalog",
        "description": null,
        "aggregateFunctions":
          {
            "bool_and": { "returnType": "bool" },
            "bool_or": { "returnType": "bool" },
            "every": { "returnType": "bool" },
          },
        "comparisonOperators":
          {
            "_eq":
              {
                // The name that appears in the data connector schema "operatorName": "=",
                // Name of the operator in the database "operatorKind": "equal",
                // The canonical equality operator (for relationships) "argumentType": "char",
                "isInfix":
                  true // Indication of whether the operator is syntactically a binary // infix operator or a binary
                  prefix-function,
              },
            "_gt":
              {
                "operatorName": ">",
                "operatorKind": "custom",
                // A non-equality operator "argumentType": "char",
                "isInfix": true,
              },
            ...,
          },
        "typeRepresentation": "boolean",
      },
  }
```

The `aggregateFunctions` field declares the aggregation functions that are defined for the scalar type. The
introspection process is capable of discovering all compatible aggregation functions.

The only aggregation functions supported are those that take a single argument, which include most builtin functions.

:::info Global scope

Note that the support for aggregation function is not yet aware of schema namespacing. User-defined aggrate functions
should be defined in the `search_path` of the database user used by the data connector (e.g., the `public` schema).

:::

The `comparisonOperators` field declares the comparison operators that are defined for the scalar type. A comparison
operator is any function that takes two arguments and returns a `bool` value. An operator is recorded under the scalar
type declaration of its first argument.

The introspection process is capable of discovering all compatible comparison operators, including those accessible
through implicit casts.

Many comparison operators in PostgreSQL are syntactically applied as binary infix operators and denoted by
non-alphabetical symbols. Therefore we map the names of infix operators. This process is controlled by the
`introspectionOptions.comparisonOperatorMapping` field.

Regular functions which use prefix-application syntax are also usable as comparison operators. These too are
discoverable by the introspection process. However, there is a large body of pre-existing functions that appear to be
comparison functions according to their type (i.e., they take two arguments and return a bool) yet can't be meaningfully
said to be performing a comparison operation (such as
[`pg_has_role`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-info.html#FUNCTIONS-INFO-ACCESS-TABLE)). Therefore,
only the names mentioned in
[`introspectionOptions.introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators`](#introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators) are
considered by the introspection process.

:::info Global scope

Note that the support for comparison operators is not yet aware of schema namespacing. User-defined comparison operators
should be defined in the `search_path` of the database user used by the data connector (e.g., the `public` or
`pg_catalog` schemas).

:::

The `typeRepresentation` field defines the type representations of the scalar type. If a type does not have a defined
type representation, the default type representation is opaque json.

The type representation of a scalar type indicates what values are considered acceptable in requests, and what values
are expected to be returned in the response.

## `introspectionOptions`

This field collects various options that may be used to drive the configuration and introspection process.

### `excludedSchemas`

The `introspectionOptions.excludedSchemas` field is a list of schema names that the introspection process will ignore.
The default value includes schemas used for internal database bookkeeping and reflection, such as `information_schema`,
for PostgreSQL and common extensions.

**Example (default)**

```yaml
"excludedSchemas": [
    "information_schema", # PostgreSQL
    "pg_catalog", # PostgreSQL
    "tiger", # PostGIS extension
    "crdb_internal", # CockroachDB
    "columnar", # Citus
    "columnar_internal", # Citus
  ]
```

### `unqualifiedSchemasForTables`

The `introspectionOptions.unqualifiedSchemasForTables` field identifies schemas for which the introspection process will
generate table metadata entries that are not prefixed by the schema name.

Tables defined in schemas in this list will have metadata entries that of the form `<table_name>`. Those defined in
schemas not in this list will have metadata entries that of the form `<schema_name>_<table_name>`.

**Example (default)**

```yaml
"unqualifiedSchemasForTables": [
  "public"
],
```

### `unqualifiedSchemasForTypesAndProcedures`

The `introspectionOptions.unqualifiedSchemasForTypesAndProcedures` field identifies schemas for which the introspection
process will generate type and comparison operator metadata entries that are not prefixed by the schema name, similar to
the same for tables.

:::info Global scope

Comparison operators and types only support unqualified access i.e. global scoping currently. Consequentially, types and
operators defined in any schema not in this list will not be discoverable.

:::

**Example (default)**

```yaml
"unqualifiedSchemasForTypesAndProcedures": [
  "public",
  "pg_catalog",
  "tiger"
],
```

### `comparisonOperatorMapping`

The `introspectionOptions.comparisonOperatorMapping` field describes the names that will be used to represent infix
comparison operators such as `=`, `!=`, `LIKE`, `<`, etc.

In order for the introspection process to discover a given operator it must have an entry in this list.

**Example (default, truncated)**

```yaml
"comparisonOperatorMapping":
  [
    { "operatorName": "=", "exposedName": "_eq", "operatorKind": "equal" },
    { "operatorName": "<=", "exposedName": "_lte", "operatorKind": "custom" },
    ...,
  ]
```

### `introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators` {#introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators}

The `introspectionOptions.introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators` gives the list of prefix-functions that are
candidates for comparison operators.

Because of the wide variety of predefined functions in existence this is an inclusion list rather than an exclusion
list. Functions not appearing in this list will not be discoverable by the introspection process.

**Example (default, truncated)**

```yaml
"introspectPrefixFunctionComparisonOperators": ["box_above", "box_below", "box_contain", ...]
```

### `typeRepresentations`

The `typeRepresentations` field define the TypeRepresentation that the introspection process will assign to the types it
encounters.

**Example**

The default initial type representation mappings:

```yaml
"typeRepresentations":
  {
    "bit": "string",
    "bool": "boolean",
    "bpchar": "string",
    "char": "string",
    "date": "date",
    "float4": "float32",
    "float8": "float64",
    "int2": "int16",
    "int4": "int32",
    "int8": "int64AsString",
    "numeric": "bigDecimalAsString",
    "text": "string",
    "time": "time",
    "timestamp": "timestamp",
    "timestamptz": "timestamptz",
    "timetz": "timetz",
    "uuid": "uUID",
    "varchar": "string",
  }
```

The type representation guides how the Postgresql type will be exposed in the final DDN API of the project, and may
influence the output format of queries as well.

For example, type representations enable the API generation to assign e.g. the GraphQL type `String` to all of the
Postgresql types `varchar`, `text` etc.

#### `int8` and `numeric` types

The default type representations of `int8` and `numeric` types are `int64AsString` and `bigDecimalAsString`
respectively. These indicate that values accepted in requests and returned in response will have a string value json
representation, to improve compatibility with common JavaScript clients.

It is possible to configure this option to represent these types as numbers instead. To do so, configure the type
representation of the `int8` type to `int64`, and/or configure the type representation of the `numeric` type to
`bigDecimal` as follows:

## `mutationsVersion`

:::warning Experimental feature under ongoing development

Developing support for mutations of tables is an ongoing effort that has still not settled on a concrete form. The
`mutationsVersion` field is essentially a feature flag toggle that will let you opt-in to trying this feature as it
evolves.

Beware that the set of supported mutations versions is expected to have a rapid turnover, and there is no guarantee that
two successive configuration versions will have any overlap in the mutations versions they support.

:::

The `mutationsVersion` field indicates the flavor of table mutations to expose in the schema of the data connector. By
default this field is omitted, resulting in no mutations being generated.

Introduction and removal of supported mutations versions will only happen in the context of a version bump of the main
configuration.

The currently supported value are `"v1"`, `"v2"`, where the latest version is preferred.

### `mutationsVersion: "v1"`

A table `my_table` gets a `v1_insert_my_table` mutation in the connector schema which takes a single argument `_object`
of object type equivalent to the type of the table. It is a runtime error to insert into columns that are generated. The
mutation result type is that of the table, allowing selection of fields from the row that was inserted.

A table `my_table` with a single-column primary key `my_id_column` gets a `v1_delete_my_table_by_my_id_column` mutation
with a single argument `my_id_column` of type equal to that of the column. The mutation result type is that of the
table, allowing selection of fields from the row that was deleted.

This version of mutations does not support filter-based permissions.

### `mutationsVersion: "v2"`

"v2" of auto-generated mutations introduces insert, delete and update point mutations per table that include permission
arguments.

We generate the following procedures:

- A single insert procedure is generated per table, and has the following form:

  ```graphql
  v2_insert_<table>(
      objects: [<table-object>],
      post_check: <boolexpr>
  )
  ```

  Using it, we can insert multiple objects and include a post check for permissions.

- A delete procedure is generated per table X unique constraint, and has the following form:

  ```graphql
  v2_delete_<table>_by_<column_and_...>(
      key_<column1>: <value>,
      key_<column2>: <value>,
      ...,
      pre_check: <boolexpr>
  )
  ```

  Using it, we can delete a single row using the uniqueness constraint, and include a pre check for permissions.

- An update procedure is generated per table X unique constraint, and has the following form:

  ```graphql
  v2_update_<table>_by_<column_and_...>(
      key_<column1>: <value>,
      key_<column2>: <value>,
      ...,
      update_columns: { <column>: { _set: <value> }, ... },
      pre_check: <boolexpr>,
      post_check: <boolexpr>
  )
  ```

  Using it, we can update a single row using the uniqueness constraint by updating the relevant columns, and include a
  pre check and post check for permissions.

For each `pre_check` and `post_check` arguments of a mutation, an
[Argument Preset](/reference/metadata-reference/permissions#commandpermissions-argumentpreset) can be set in the
mutation's [Command Permissions](/reference/metadata-reference/permissions#commandpermissions-commandpermission).

These checks are now optional as of release `v1.2.0`, allowing greater flexibility based on your specific permissions
requirements. If a `pre_check` or `post_check` is not specified, the mutation will proceed without those checks by
default.

## `mutationsPrefix: ""`

The `mutationsPrefix` configuration option is an optional string that controls the prefix applied to mutation names.

- **Existing Projects**: By default, if `mutationsPrefix` is not set (i.e., null), the prefix will default to
  `v2_mutation_name`.
- **Customization**: You can customize this prefix by setting `mutationsPrefix` to any string, such as
  `foo_mutation_name`.
- **New Projects (Default)**: For new projects, `mutationsPrefix` is set to an empty string (`""`), removing the prefix
  entirely, which is the preferred setup for most users.

Setting `mutationsPrefix`: "" will completely remove the prefix, simplifying mutation names in line with common user
preferences.
