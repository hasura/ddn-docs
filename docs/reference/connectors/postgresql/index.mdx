# PostgreSQL

## Introduction

The Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL is our flagship connector, with rich support for all kinds of queries and
mutations. In the sections below, we'll try to give an overview of the features of the PostgreSQL connector and how to
configure it in a Hasura DDN project.

:::tip Looking to get started?

If you've ended up here and aren't concerned about tweaking your configuration, and rather are looking to get started
with PostgreSQL and Hasura DDN as quickly as possible, check out our
[PostgreSQL tutorial](/how-to-build-with-ddn/with-postgresql.mdx) or
[learn how to connect](/data-sources/connect-to-a-source.mdx) to a PostgreSQL instance.
