# Snowflake

## Introduction

Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for Snowflake, providing integration with Snowflake instances. This
connector allows you to leverage Snowflake’s powerful capabilities while taking advantage of Hasura’s metadata-driven
approach. Here, we’ll explore the key features of the Snowflake connector and walk through the configuration process
within a Hasura DDN project.

:::info Important Considerations for Using Hasura DDN with Snowflake

Snowflake is an analytical data source optimized for large-scale data analysis and complex queries. When integrating
Snowflake with Hasura DDN, it’s essential to recognize that the performance of your API will be directly influenced by
the query performance of Snowflake. As a result, response times may vary depending on the complexity and volume of the
queries executed. **Use this connector and Snowflake for scenarios where analytical query performance is acceptable.**

Snowflake is not designed for transactional use cases that require low-latency operations, high-frequency updates, or
real-time responses. **Avoid using Hasura DDN with Snowflake for applications that require rapid transactional
processing.**
