## Introduction

Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for MySQL, providing integration with MySQL databases. This connector allows
you to leverage MySQL’s powerful relational database capabilities while taking advantage of Hasura’s metadata-driven
approach. Here, we’ll explore the key features of the MySQL connector and walk through the configuration process within
a Hasura DDN project.
