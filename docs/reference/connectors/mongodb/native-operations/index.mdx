# Native Operations

## Introduction

Native Operations allow you to run custom SQL queries on your MongoDB database. This allows you to run queries that are
not supported by Hasura DDN's GraphQL engine. This unlocks the full power of your database, allowing you to run complex
queries and mutations directly from your Hasura GraphQL API.
