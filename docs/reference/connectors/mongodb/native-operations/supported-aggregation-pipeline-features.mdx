# Supported aggregation pipeline features

Native queries use [aggregation pipelines][] as the format for custom MongoDB queries. Native query configurations must
include type declarations for inputs and outputs for the native query's pipeline. The DDN CLI is able to type check
aggregation pipelines to write type declarations automatically (see [Manage native queries with the DDN CLI][]). But
this feature is in beta, and only supports a subset of aggregation pipeline features.

## Supported pipeline stages

An aggregation pipeline is a list of [aggregation stages][] that each filter, transform, or sort documents that flow
through them. Hasura's beta pipeline type inference currently supports these stages:

[aggregation stages]: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/

| Stage          | Connector Version |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| `$documents`   | 1.5.0             |
| `$group`       | 1.5.0             |
| `$limit`       | 1.5.0             |
| `$match`       | 1.5.0             |
| `$project`     | 1.5.0             |
| `$replaceRoot` | 1.5.0             |
| `$replaceWith` | 1.5.0             |
| `$skip`        | 1.5.0             |
| `$sort`        | 1.5.0             |
| `$unwind`      | 1.5.0             |

## Supported query predicate operators

Certain stages, such as `$match`, use a specific format called a **query predicate**. These are not general purpose
expressions - they are specialized for determining a match against an input document. Hasura's beta pipeline type
inference currently supports these query predicate operators:

| Query Predicate Operator                        | Connector Version |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `$all`                                          | 1.5.0             |
| `$and` / `$or` / `$nor`                         | 1.5.0             |
| `$elemMatch`                                    | 1.5.0             |
| `$eq` / `$ne` / `$gt` / `$lt` / `$gte` / `$lte` | 1.5.0             |
| `$exists`                                       | 1.5.0             |
| `$expr`                                         | 1.5.0             |
| `$in` / `$nin`                                  | 1.5.0             |
| `$mod`                                          | 1.5.0             |
| `$not`                                          | 1.5.0             |
| `$size`                                         | 1.5.0             |
| `$type`                                         | 1.5.0             |

## Supported aggregation expression operators

Aggregation pipelines use **aggregation expressions** to reference document values, or to express logic. Note that these
are not the operators typically used in the `$match` stage, but you do see these in, for example, `$replaceWith` and
`$project` stages.

Hasura's beta pipeline type inference currently supports these aggregation expression operators:

| Expression Operator                                                                                                   | Connector Version |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `$abs`                                                                                                                | 1.5.0             |
| `$add` / `$divide` / `$multiply` / `$subtract`                                                                        | 1.5.0             |
| `$allElementsTrue` / `$anyElementTrue`                                                                                | 1.5.0             |
| `$and` / `$or`                                                                                                        | 1.5.0             |
| `$arrayElemAt`                                                                                                        | 1.5.0             |
| `$eq` / `$gt` / `$gte` / `$lt` / `$lte` / `$ne`                                                                       | 1.5.0             |
| `$not`                                                                                                                | 1.5.0             |
| `$sin` / `$cos` / `$tan` / `$asin` / `$acos` / `$atan` / `$asinh` / `$acosh` / `$atanh` / `$sinh` / `$cosh` / `$tanh` | 1.5.0             |
| `$split`                                                                                                              | 1.5.0             |

## Supported accumulators

Accumulators are used in stages like `$group` and `$bucket`.

Hasura's beta pipeline type inference currently supports these accumulators:

| Accumulator     | Connector Version |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| `$avg`          | 1.5.0             |
| `$count`        | 1.5.0             |
| `$min` / `$max` | 1.5.0             |
| `$push`         | 1.5.0             |
| `$sum`          | 1.5.0             |
