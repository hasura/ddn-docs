# Type Expressions in Connector Configuration

Connector [configuration](./configuration.mdx) includes configuration for database collection schemas, and native
operations. Each of these require **type expressions** to specify the types of collection fields, native operation
arguments, and native operation outputs. For example here is a schema configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "users",
  "collections": {
    "users": {
      "type": "users"
    }
  },
  "objectTypes": {
    "users": {
      "fields": {
        "_id": {
          "type": { "scalar": "objectId" },
          "description": "primary key"
        },
        "name": {
          "type": { "scalar": "string" }
        },
        "metadata": {
          "type": "extendedJSON"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This example specifies the collection object type, an object type called `users`, and provides a definition for that
object type with types for its `_id` and `_name` fields.

Types are expressed as JSON objects with (in most cases) a single field to distinguish scalar types vs the different
complex types.

## Scalar types

Scalar types are given as an object with a `scalar` key:

```json
{ "scalar": "string" }
```

The exception is the scalar type `extendJSON` which is expressed as a string instead of an object:

```json
"extendedJSON"
```

See [Connector Types](./connector-types.mdx#scalar-types) for a list of available scalar types.

## Nullable types

To get a nullable type wrap any other type in an object with a `nullable` property:

```json
{ "nullable": { "scalar": "string" } }
```

```json
{ "nullable": "extendedJSON" }
```

Values of nullable types may be values allowed by the underlying type, or they may be `null`.

## Array types

To get an array type wrap any other type in an object with an `arrayOf` property:

```json
{ "arrayOf": { "scalar": "string" } }
```

Arrays are homogeneous: every element of the array is assigned the same type.

## Object types

Objects are record types with a fixed set of string keys, and a distinct type for each key.

A reference to an object type is given by an object with an `object` property whose value is the name of an object type.

```json
{ "object": "TypeName" }
```

All object types are named types - there is no option for inline, anonymous object types.

Definitions for object types are given in `objectTypes` maps in connector configuration files.

```json
  "objectTypes": {
    "users": {
      "fields": {
        "_id": {
          "type": { "scalar": "objectId" },
          "description": "primary key"
        },
        "name": {
          "type": { "scalar": "string" }
        },
        "metadata": {
          "type": "extendedJSON"
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

The above example defines an object type called `users`. Each field of the object type has a required `type` field that
uses the type expression syntax described on this page, and an optional `description` field which may contain markdown.

These `objectTypes` maps can appear in each schema, native query, and native mutation file. The definitions from every
configuration file are merged into one shared namespace. This has two implications:

- Every object type name must be unique across all configuration files for the same connector.
- Each configuration file may reference object types defined in any other configuration file. For example a native query
  may reference an object type defined in a schema configuration file.
