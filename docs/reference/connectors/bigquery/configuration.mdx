# Configuration Reference

## Introduction

The configuration is a metadata object that lists all the database entities — such as tables — that the data connector
has to know about in order to serve queries. It never changes during the lifetime of the data connector service
instance. When your database schema changes you will have to update the configuration accordingly, see
[updating with introspection](#updating-with-introspection).

## Structure

The configuration object is a JSON object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "connection_uri": {
    "value": "...",
    "variable": "..."
  },
  "connection_pool_settings": {
    "max_connections": 10,
    "min_idle": 1,
    "connection_timeout": 30000,
    "initialization_fail_timeout": 30000
  },
  "schemas": ["public"],
  "tables": [...],
  "functions": [],
  "native_operations": {}
}
```

### Property: connection_uri

The connection URI for the BigQuery database. This is a required field that can be specified either as a direct string
value or as a reference to an environment variable:

```json
{
  "connection_uri": {
    "value": "jdbc:bigquery://https://www.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2:443;ProjectId=your-project-id;OAuthType=0;OAuthServiceAcctEmail=your-service-account-email;OAuthPvtKeyPath=/path/to/key.json;"
  }
}
```

Or using an environment variable:

```json
{
  "connection_uri": {
    "variable": "BIGQUERY_JDBC_URL"
  }
}
```

### Property: schemas

This is an optional array of schema names to include in the introspection process. If not provided, all schemas will be
included. **Any schema passed in the JDBC URL will take precedence.**

Example:

```json
{
  "schemas": ["schema1", "schema2"]
}
```

### Property: tables

An array of table definitions generated automatically during introspection. Each table definition includes metadata
about the table structure, columns, primary keys, and foreign keys.

Example:

```json
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "name": "mydataset.customers",
      "description": "Customer information table",
      "category": "TABLE",
      "columns": [
        {
          "name": "customer_id",
          "description": "Unique customer identifier",
          "type": {
            "scalar_type": "INT64"
          },
          "nullable": false,
          "auto_increment": false,
          "is_primarykey": true
        },
        {
          "name": "name",
          "description": "Customer name",
          "type": {
            "scalar_type": "STRING"
          },
          "nullable": false,
          "auto_increment": false
        },
        {
          "name": "location",
          "description": "Geographic location",
          "type": {
            "scalar_type": "GEOGRAPHY"
          },
          "nullable": true,
          "auto_increment": false
        },
        {
          "name": "tags",
          "description": "Customer tags",
          "type": {
            "array_type": {
              "scalar_type": "STRING"
            }
          },
          "nullable": true,
          "auto_increment": false
        }
      ],
      "primary_keys": ["customer_id"],
      "foreign_keys": {
        "fk_customer_order": {
          "column_mapping": {
            "customer_id": "customer_id"
          },
          "foreign_collection": "mydataset.orders"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note BigQuery specific characteristics

- BigQuery uses datasets as schema equivalents
- Primary keys are not enforced by BigQuery but can be defined in the configuration
- Foreign key relationships are not enforced by BigQuery but can be defined in the configuration
- Certain BigQuery-specific types like GEOGRAPHY, STRUCT, and ARRAY are represented in a way that maintains
  compatibility with the NDC protocol
