# BigQuery

## Introduction

Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for BigQuery, providing integration with BigQuery databases. This connector
allows you to leverage BigQuery's powerful data analytics and storage capabilities while taking advantage of Hasura's
metadata-driven approach. Here, we'll explore the key features of the BigQuery connector and walk through the
configuration process within a Hasura DDN project.
