# DuckDB

## Introduction

Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for DuckDB, providing integration with DuckDB databases. This connector
allows you to leverage DuckDB’s powerful OLAP capabilities while taking advantage of Hasura’s
metadata-driven approach. Here, we’ll explore the key features of the DuckDB connector and walk through the
configuration process within a Hasura DDN project.
