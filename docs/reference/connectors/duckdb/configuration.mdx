# Configuration Reference

## Introduction

The configuration is a metadata object that lists all the database entities — such as collections — that the data
connector has to know about in order to serve queries. It never changes during the lifetime of the data connector
service instance. When your database schema changes you will have to update the configuration accordingly, see
[updating with introspection](#updating-with-introspection).

## Structure

The configuration object is a JSON object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "collection_names": [],
    "collection_aliases": {},
    "object_types": {},
    "functions": [],
    "procedures": []
  }
}
```

### Property: Collection Names

This is an array of collection names that the connector will expose for querying. This is a required field.

Example:

```json
{
  "collection_names": ["posts", "users"]
}
```

### Property: Collection Aliases

This is a JSON object mapping collection names to their full path in the database. This allows you to reference
collections with simpler names.

Example:

```json
{
  "collection_aliases": {
    "posts": "data.main.posts",
    "users": "data.main.users"
  }
}
```

### Property: Object Types

This is a JSON object containing definitions for each collection's structure, including fields and their types.

Example:

```json
{
  "object_types": {
    "posts": {
      "fields": {
        "id": {
          "type": {
            "type": "nullable",
            "underlying_type": {
              "type": "named",
              "name": "Int"
            }
          },
          "description": "No description available"
        },
        "title": {
          "type": {
            "type": "nullable",
            "underlying_type": {
              "type": "named",
              "name": "String"
            }
          },
          "description": "No description available"
        }
      },
      "description": "No description available"
    }
  }
}
```

Each field definition includes:

- Field name
- Type specification (including nullability)
- Description

Supported types include:

- `Int`
- `String`
- `Timestamp`
- `Boolean`
- `Float`
- `Double`
- `Decimal`

### Property: Functions

This is an array of function definitions that can be called through the connector.

Example:

```json
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "get_post_by_id",
      "arguments": {
        "post_id": {
          "type": {
            "type": "named",
            "name": "Int"
          },
          "description": "The ID of the post to retrieve"
        }
      },
      "return_type": {
        "type": "object",
        "name": "posts"
      },
      "description": "Retrieves a post by its ID"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Property: Procedures

This is an array of procedure definitions that can be executed through the connector.

Example:

```json
{
  "procedures": [
    {
      "name": "create_new_post",
      "arguments": {
        "user_id": {
          "type": {
            "type": "named",
            "name": "Int"
          },
          "description": "The user ID for the new post"
        },
        "title": {
          "type": {
            "type": "named",
            "name": "String"
          },
          "description": "The title of the new post"
        },
        "content": {
          "type": {
            "type": "named",
            "name": "String"
          },
          "description": "The content of the new post"
        }
      },
      "description": "Creates a new post in the database"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Updating with introspection

Whenever the schema of your database changes you will need to update your data connector configuration accordingly to
reflect those changes.

Running `update` in a configuration directory will do the following:

- Connect to the DuckDB database and scan all available collections
- Update the `collection_names`, `collection_aliases`, and `object_types` fields to reflect the current database schema
- Preserve any custom functions and procedures defined in the configuration
