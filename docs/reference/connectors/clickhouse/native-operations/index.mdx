# Native Operations

## Introduction

Native Operations allow you to run custom SQL queries on your ClickHouse database. This allows you to run queries that
are not supported by Hasura DDN's GraphQL engine. This unlocks the full power of your database, allowing you to run
complex queries directly from your Hasura GraphQL API.
