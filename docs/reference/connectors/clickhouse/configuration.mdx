# Configuration

## Introduction

When you integrate the ClickHouse connector into a subgraph using the CLI, it first creates a new subdirectory in that
subgraph containing a templated configuration file. After you input the connection string and execute the update
command, the CLI will introspect your ClickHouse instance and automatically finalize the configuration for you.

## Manually editing the connector configuration

It is possible to manually modify the configuration, and valid changes will be preserved when the configuration is
updated.

The configuration file is accompanied by a json schema file which will help validate any manually written changes.

### Table alias

The keys in the tables object in the configuration file can be changed to modify the alias a table will be exposed
under.

This alias must remain unique.

### Table Return Type

Tables can return the same type as another table. This is useful for views that return rows from another table.

This will allow both tables to share an object type, which in turn allows both tables to share relationships and object
type permissions.
