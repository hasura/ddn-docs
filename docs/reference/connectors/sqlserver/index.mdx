# SQLServer

## Introduction

The Native Data Connector for SQL Server supports all kinds of queries and mutations. In the sections below, we'll try
to give an overview of the features of the SQL Server connector and how to configure it in a Hasura DDN project.

Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for SQL Server, providing integration with SQL Server databases. This connector
allows you to leverage SQL Server’s powerful relational database capabilities while taking advantage of Hasura’s
metadata-driven approach. Here, we’ll explore the key features of the SQL Server connector and walk through the
configuration process within a Hasura DDN project.
