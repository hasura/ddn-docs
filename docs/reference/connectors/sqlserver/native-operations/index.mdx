# Native Operations

## Introduction

Native Operations allow you to run custom SQL queries on your SQL Server database. This allows you to run queries that
are not supported by Hasura DDN's GraphQL engine. This unlocks the full power of your database and allows you to run
complex queries, mutations, and even vector searches â€” all directly from your Hasura GraphQL API.
