# Native Operations

## Introduction

Native Operations allow you to run custom SQL queries on your SQL Server database. This allows you to run queries that
are not supported by Hasura DDN's GraphQL engine. This unlocks the full power of your database, allowing you to:

- Execute complex SQL queries beyond Hasura's standard GraphQL operations
- Perform custom mutations, data aggregations and transformations
- Call stored procedures and functions

## Types of Native Operations

Hasura supports three types of native operations for SQL Server:

1. **Native Queries** - Read-only SQL queries that return data
2. **Native Mutations** - SQL statements that modify data and return results
3. **Stored Procedures** - Pre-defined database procedures that can be executed
