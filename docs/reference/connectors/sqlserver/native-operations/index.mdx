# Native Operations

## Introduction

Native Operations allow you to execute custom SQL queries and mutations directly on your SQL Server database through
Hasura's GraphQL API. This powerful feature enables you to:

- Run complex SQL queries beyond Hasura's standard GraphQL operations
- Execute custom mutations to modify data
- Call stored procedures
- Perform vector searches and other advanced database operations

## Types of Native Operations

Hasura supports three types of native operations for SQL Server:

1. **Native Queries** - Read-only SQL queries that return data
2. **Native Mutations** - SQL statements that modify data and return results
3. **Stored Procedures** - Pre-defined database procedures that can be executed
