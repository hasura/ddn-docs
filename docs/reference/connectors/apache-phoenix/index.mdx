# Apache Phoenix

## Introduction

Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for Apache Phoenix, providing integration with Apache Phoenix databases. This connector
allows you to leverage Apache Phoenix’s powerful relational database capabilities while taking advantage of Hasura’s
metadata-driven approach. Here, we’ll explore the key features of the Apache Phoenix connector and walk through the
configuration process within a Hasura DDN project.
