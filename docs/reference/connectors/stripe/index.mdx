# Stripe

## Introduction

Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for Stripe, providing integration via
[Stripe's OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/stripe/openapi). This connector allows you to
[leverage Stripe's REST API](https://docs.stripe.com/api) while taking advantage of Hasura’s metadata-driven approach.
Here, we’ll explore the key features of the Stripe connector and walk through the configuration process within a Hasura
DDN project.
