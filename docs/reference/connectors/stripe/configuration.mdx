# Configuration Reference

## Introduction

Under the hood, the Stripe connector utilizes the [`ndc-http` connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-http) via
[Stripe's OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/stripe/openapi). This ensures you can incorporate any resources available via
[Stripe's REST API](https://docs.stripe.com/api) into your supergraph.

## Schema

As the schema for this connector is mapped to the OpenAPI spec for Stripe's API, the connector does not generate any
local configuration files. Instead, when you introspect your data source,
[this JSON schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/ndc-stripe/refs/heads/main/config/schema.json) is used to
generate a [`DataConnectorLink`](/reference/metadata-reference/data-connector-links.mdx) in your subgraph's metadata,
complete with all the resources available via Stripe's API.

To explore this file, [try out the how-to guide for Stripe](/how-to-build-with-ddn/with-stripe.mdx) and — after
introspecting — grep through the generated HML file for any endpoint you desire.
