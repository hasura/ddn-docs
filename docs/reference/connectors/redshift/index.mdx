# Redshift

## Introduction

Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for Amazon Redshift, providing seamless integration with Redshift clusters.
This connector allows you to leverage Redshift's powerful data warehousing capabilities while taking advantage of
Hasura's metadata-driven approach. Here, we'll explore the key features of the Redshift connector and walk through the
configuration process within a Hasura DDN project.

:::info Important Considerations for Using Hasura DDN with Redshift

Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service optimized for large-scale data analysis and
complex queries. When integrating Redshift with Hasura DDN, it's essential to recognize that the performance of your API
will be directly influenced by the query performance of Redshift. As a result, response times may vary depending on the
complexity and volume of the queries executed. **Use this connector and Redshift for scenarios where data warehouse
query performance is acceptable.**

Redshift is designed for complex analytical queries and data warehousing rather than transactional use cases that
require low-latency operations, high-frequency updates, or real-time responses. **Avoid using Hasura DDN with Redshift
for applications that require rapid transactional processing or OLTP workloads.**
