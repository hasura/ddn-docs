# Configuration

## Introduction

The `configuration.json` file is responsible for establishing connections between your GraphQL connector and the exposed
API. You can configure different settings for introspection and query execution.

## Structure

```json title="When you first initialize a GraphQL connector, this structure will be generated automatically:"
{
  "$schema": "configuration.schema.json",
  "introspection": {
    "endpoint": {
      "valueFromEnv": "GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT"
    }
  },
  "execution": {
    "endpoint": {
      "valueFromEnv": "GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT"
    }
  }
}
```

### `$schema`

The `$schema` references a `configuration.schema.json` schema that will contain all the information necessary to
introspect and execute queries against your existing API.

You can explore this file by opening `<subgraph_name>/connector/<connector_name>/configuration.schema.json`

### `introspection`

The `introspection` object can be configured to accept headers.

```json title="E.g.:"
 "headers": {
      "X-Hasura-Admin-Secret": {
        "value": "secret-admin-key-from-a-v2-project"
      },
      "Content-Type": {
        "value": "application/json"
      }
    }
  },
```

### `execution`

```json title="Here, we're forwarding the Authorization header for use in the existing GraphQL API:"
{
  ...
  "execution": {
    "endpoint": {
      "valueFromEnv": "ANOTHER_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT"
    },
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": {
        "value": "application/json"
      }
    }
  },
}
```

:::info Why use different configurations for introspection and execution?

For introspection, we're connecting to an existing Hasura v2 project using the x-hasura-admin-secret. This grants access
as the admin role, ensuring full visibility over the entire schema â€” ideal for discovering all available types,
relationships, and permissions.

For execution, however, you may want more flexibility. You can specify a different endpoint, or use different headers
and roles that match the actual production or client-facing environment, rather than the elevated admin role.

### `request` (optional)

#### `forwardHeaders`

A list of request headers to forward. Defaults to `[]`, meaning no headers are forwarded by default. Supports glob
patterns (e.g., `"X-Hasura-*"`).

**Note:** Enabling this requires additional configuration on the DDN side. Refer to these
[docs](/reference/connectors/graphql/header-passthrough.mdx) for details.

#### `headersArgument`

Specifies the name of the headers argument. Defaults to `"_headers"`.

Make sure the name does **not** conflict with any existing arguments of root fields in the target schema. Change it to a
different value if a conflict exists.

#### `headersTypeName`

Specifies the name of the headers argument type. Defaults to `"_HeaderMap"`.

Ensure this type name does **not** conflict with existing types in the target schema. Change it to a different value if
a conflict occurs.

### `response` (optional)

#### `forwardHeaders`

A list of request headers to forward. Defaults to `[]`, meaning no headers are forwarded by default. Supports glob
patterns (e.g., `"X-Hasura-*"`).

**Note:** Enabling this requires additional configuration on the DDN side. Refer to these
[docs](/reference/connectors/graphql/header-passthrough.mdx) for details.

#### `headersField`

Name of the headers field in the response type. Defaults to `headers`.

#### `responseField`

Name of the response field in the response type. Defaults to `response`.

#### `typeNamePrefix`

Prefix for response type names. Defaults to `_`. Generated response type names must be unique once prefix and suffix are
applied.

#### `typeNameSuffix`

Suffix for response type names. Defaults to `Response`. Generated response type names must be unique once prefix and
suffix are applied.

:::tip Use environment variables

Any literal `"value"` in the configuration can be replaced with `"valueFromEnv"` in order to read from environments.
