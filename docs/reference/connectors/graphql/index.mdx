# GraphQL

## Introduction

The GraphQL connector enables you to connect existing GraphQL APIs to your Hasura DDN API. Here we'll provide an
overview of the features offered by the connector and guide you through the configuration process within a Hasura DDN
project.

Below, you'll find a matrix of all supported features for the GraphQL connector:

| Feature            | Supported | Notes                                               |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Queries            | ✅        | All features that the DDN engine currently supports |
| Mutations          | ✅        |                                                     |
| Header Passthrough | ✅        | Entire headers can be forwarded                     |
