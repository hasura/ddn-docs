# Native Queries

## Introduction

Native Queries allow you to run custom SQL queries on your Oracle database. These allow you to run queries that are not
supported by Hasura's GraphQL engine as virtual tables in Oracle.

Native queries can also be added directly to the configuration.json, but it is deprecated now in favour of the following.


## Structure

A Native Query is a single SQL statement that returns results and can take arguments. The SQL structure of a Native
Query is specified in the [Native Operation syntax](/reference/connectors/oracle/native-operations/syntax.mdx) page.

## Create a Native Query

To create a new Native Query, create a new SQL file inside the connector configuration directory, then use the `ddn` CLI
to add it to the connector configuration. For example:

1. Create a new directory structure under the connector configuration:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p my_subgraph/connector/oracle-connector/native_operations/queries/
   ```

2. Create a new SQL file `my_subgraph/connector/oracle-connector/native_operations/queries/artist_by_id_between.sql` with
   the following content:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM "Artist"
   WHERE "Name" LIKE {{name}}
     AND "ArtistId" > {{lower_bound}}
     AND "ArtistId" < {{upper_bound}}
   ```

3. Create a new entry in the connector configuration:

   NOTE: The `operation-path` provided should be relative to the configuration directory. It means that for the below case,
   the SQL file is expected to be present at `<ddn-project-root>/my_subgraph/connector/oracle-connector/native-operations/queries/artist_by_id_between.sql`

   ```sh
   ddn connector plugin --connector my_subgraph/connector/oracle-connector/connector.yaml -- \
     native-queries create --operation-path native_operations/queries/artist_by_id_between.sql --name artist_by_id_between
   ```

4. If your data connector is running, run the following command to update your metadata to track the new native query:

   ```sh
   ddn connector-link update oracle_connector --add-all-resources
   ```

   If you get a `connection refused` error, it means that your data connector is not running. You can either start the
   data connector and try again, or, run the following commands to update your metadata to track the new native query:

   ```sh
   # start the connector and introspect your DB
   ddn connector introspect oracle_connector

   # update your metadata to track the new native query
   ddn model add oracle_connector "artist_by_id_between"
   ```

## Updating a Native Query

A Native Query can be updated with the `create` command and setting the `--overwrite` option. For example:

```sh
ddn connector plugin --connector my_subgraph/connector/oracle_connector/connector.yaml -- \
  native-queries create --name artist_by_id_between --operation-path native_operations/queries/artist_by_id_between.sql  --overwrite
```

### Usage

With the example above, you can then use the query in your GraphQL API like this:

```graphql
query {
  artist_by_id_between(args: {name: "Black", lower_bound: 10, upper_bound: 50}) {
    ArtistId
    Name
  }
}
```
