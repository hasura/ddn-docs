# Configuration Reference

## Introduction

The configuration is a metadata object that lists all the database entities — such as collections and fields — that the
data connector has to know about in order to serve queries. It never changes during the lifetime of the data connector
service instance. When your database schema changes you will have to update the configuration accordingly, see
[updating with introspection](#updating-with-introspection).

## Structure

The configuration object is a JSON object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "collection_names": [],
    "object_fields": {},
    "object_types": {},
    "collection_vectors": {},
    "functions": [],
    "procedures": []
  }
}
```

### Property: Collection Names

This is an array of collection (table) names that are included in the configuration. This is a required field.

```json title="Example:"
{
  "collection_names": ["multivector_collection", "terraforming", "star_charts"]
}
```

### Property: Object Fields

This is a JSON object that maps each collection name to its field names. These field names correspond to the attributes
or columns available in each collection.

```json title="Example for a single collection:"
{
  "multivector_collection": ["name", "type", "id", "score", "vector"]
}
```

### Property: Object Types

This is a JSON object providing detailed type information for each field in every collection. It includes both required
and nullable fields, using type descriptors.

```json title="Example:"
{
  "multivector_collection": {
    "fields": {
      "id": {
        "type": {
          "type": "named",
          "name": "Int"
        }
      },
      "score": {
        "type": {
          "type": "nullable",
          "underlying_type": {
            "type": "named",
            "name": "Float"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For nullable fields, the type is wrapped in a `nullable` descriptor:

```json title="Nullable field example:"
{
  "vector": {
    "type": {
      "type": "nullable",
      "underlying_type": {
        "type": "array",
        "element_type": {
          "type": "named",
          "name": "Float"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Property: Collection Vectors

This field maps collection names to a boolean indicating whether the collection supports multi-vector search.

```json title="Example:"
{
  "terraforming_plans": true,
  "multivector_collection": false
}
```

### Property: Functions and Procedures

Arrays of function and procedure definitions.

```json
{
  "functions": [],
  "procedures": []
}
```

## Updating with introspection

Whenever the schema of your database changes you will need to update your data connector configuration accordingly to
reflect those changes.

Running `update` in a configuration directory will do the following:

- Connect to the database and refresh the collection metadata
- Update the `collection_names`, `object_fields`, and `object_types` to reflect the current database schema
- Preserve any custom configuration that doesn't conflict with the updated schema
