# Qdrant

## Introduction

Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for Qdrant, providing integration with Qdrant databases. This connector
allows you to leverage Qdrant’s powerful vector database capabilities while taking advantage of Hasura’s metadata-driven
approach. Here, we’ll explore the key features of the Qdrant connector and walk through the configuration process within
a Hasura DDN project.
