# Configuration

## Introduction

This document is the reference documentation for the Elasticsearch data connector configuration. Configuration is
currently a text file called `configuration.json` in the root folder of the connector. It is generated at the time of
introspection of the database for the first time and is used to set up the connector. Subsequent introspections (using the
`update` command) will overwrite the file. Below is an example configuration file along with explanations of its
components:

```json
{
  "indices": {
    "customers": {
      "mappings": {
        "properties": {
          "customer_id": {
            "type": "keyword"
          },
          "email": {
            "type": "keyword"
          },
          "location": {
            "type": "geo_point"
          },
          "name": {
            "fields": {
              "raw": {
                "ignore_above": 256,
                "type": "keyword"
              }
            },
            "type": "text"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "queries": {}
}
```

#### `indices`

The `indices` section reflects the indices that are available in the Elasticsearch instance. You should not edit this
section. If you wish to remove certain indices from your GraphQL API, do not import it into your Hausra DDN metadata.

#### `queries`

This section is reserved for future use and is currently not used. You should not edit this section.
