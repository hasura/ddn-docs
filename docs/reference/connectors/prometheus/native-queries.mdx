# Native Queries

## Introduction

When simple queries don't meet your need you can define native queries in the connector's `configuration.yaml` file with
prepared variables with the `${<name>}` template. Native queries are defined as collections.

```yaml
metadata:
  native_operations:
    queries:
      service_up:
        query: up{job="${job}", instance="${instance}"}
        labels:
          instance: {}
          job: {}
        arguments:
          instance:
            type: String
          job:
            type: String
```

The native query is exposed as a read-only function with two required fields `job` and `instance`.

```graphql
{
  service_up(
    args: { step: "1m", job: "node", instance: "node-exporter:9100" }
    where: { timestamp: { _gt: "2024-10-11T00:00:00Z" }, job: { _in: ["node"] } }
  ) {
    job
    instance
    values {
      timestamp
      value
    }
  }
}
```

:::info Labels aren't automatically added.

You need to define them manually. Additionally, label and value boolean expressions in `where` are used to filter
results after the query is executed.
