# Prometheus

## Introduction

Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for Prometheus. This connector allows you to time-series data about your
applications while taking advantage of Hasura’s metadata-driven approach. Here, we’ll explore the key features of the
Prometheus connector and walk through the configuration process within a Hasura DDN project.
