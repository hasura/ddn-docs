# Hasura Environments

This feature allows you to create and manage multiple environments within a project, each with its own set of secrets and configurations. Let's dive into the details.

## What are Metadata Environments?
Metadata environments in Hasura V3 are isolated environments within a project where you can work on specific sets of metadata and configurations. Each environment can have its own secrets, such as API keys or database credentials, allowing developers to work on their part of the metadata without interfering with others.

## Key Benefits of Metadata Environments
### 1. Isolation and Independence
With metadata environments, you can create separate environments for different teams or developers within a project. This isolation ensures that each team can work independently on their part of the metadata without affecting others. It also eliminates the need for separate projects across teams, streamlining collaboration.

### 2. Customized Configurations
Each metadata environment can have its own set of secrets and configurations. This allows developers to customize their environment according to their specific requirements, such as using different database credentials or API keys. It provides flexibility and control over the environment-specific settings.

### 3. Easy Build Creation and Patching
When it's time to create a build, Hasura V3 can automatically patch the different parts of the metadata from the default build, ensuring that you are always up to date without worrying about forks and branches. This simplifies the build creation process and keeps your environments in sync.

## Working with Metadata Environments
To work with metadata environments in Hasura V3, you can use the Hasura CLI or the Hasura Console. The CLI provides commands to create, manage, and switch between environments, while the Console offers a user-friendly interface to visualize and interact with the environments.

### Example Usage
Let's consider an example where you have a project with two teams, Team A and Team B. You can create two metadata environments, "Environment A" and "Environment B," and assign each team to their respective environment. This way, Team A can work on their part of the metadata in "Environment A," and Team B can work on their part in "Environment B," ensuring independence and collaboration.

```
# Create Environment A
hasura metadata env create environment_a

# Switch to Environment A
hasura metadata env set environment_a

# Create Environment B
hasura metadata env create environment_b

# Switch to Environment B
hasura metadata env set environment_b
```

## Conclusion
The metadata environments feature in Hasura V3 provides a powerful mechanism for creating isolated environments within a project, enabling independent work, customized configurations, and streamlined collaboration. By leveraging metadata environments, you can ensure a smooth and efficient development process within your project.
