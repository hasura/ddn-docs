# Hasura Namespaces

Hasura V3 introduces the namespaces feature, which allows for better organization and management of API configurations in a collaborative environment. Namespaces provide a way to avoid conflicts and enable customization within the Hasura ecosystem.

## What are Namespaces?
Namespaces in Hasura V3 are logical containers that allow you to group and isolate API configurations. Each namespace acts as a separate environment where you can define and manage your API resources without interfering with other namespaces.

## Key Benefits of Namespaces
### 1. Avoiding Naming Conflicts
Namespaces help you avoid naming conflicts when working with multiple data sources or tables that have the same names. By placing resources within different namespaces, you can namespace the tables and all related types, ensuring that they are unique and do not clash with each other.

### 2. Customization and Flexibility
Namespaces provide a solid abstraction for schema customization and naming within the Hasura ecosystem. They allow you to customize the names of tables, types, and other API resources according to your specific requirements. This customization is not just about aesthetic preference; it also enables you to handle scenarios where you have tables with the same names in different data sources and want them both on the graph.

### 3. Enhanced Collaboration
With namespaces, multiple developers can work simultaneously on different namespaces without interfering with each other's work. This promotes a collaborative environment where developers can make changes and iterate on their API configurations independently, ensuring efficient teamwork.

## Working with Namespaces
To work with namespaces in Hasura V3, you can use the Hasura CLI or the Hasura Console. The CLI provides commands to create, manage, and switch between namespaces, while the Console offers a user-friendly interface to visualize and interact with the namespaces.

Example Usage
Let's consider an example where you have two data sources, "SourceA" and "SourceB," both containing a table named "users." To avoid conflicts, you can create two namespaces, "NamespaceA" and "NamespaceB," and place the respective "users" tables within their respective namespaces. This way, you can access and manage the "users" tables independently within each namespace.

```
-- NamespaceA
namespace NamespaceA {
  table users {
    id    Int
    name  String
    email String
  }
}

-- NamespaceB
namespace NamespaceB {
  table users {
    id    Int
    name  String
    email String
  }
}
```

##Conclusion
The namespaces collaboration feature in Hasura V3 provides a powerful mechanism for organizing and customizing API configurations, avoiding naming conflicts, and enabling efficient collaboration among developers. By leveraging namespaces, you can ensure a smooth and productive development process within the Hasura ecosystem.
