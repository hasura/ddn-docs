# Firebase

## Introduction

In this recipe, you'll learn how to configure an existing [Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and
generate a JWT which you can pass in the header of your requests to Hasura. After setting up your
[AuthConfig](/supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx) object to use JWT mode, this will allow you to validate users'
identities and create [permission rules](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx) which can limit access to underlying data
served by Hasura DDN.

:::info Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have:

- A [Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/) created, with at least one authentication method enabled.
- A local application that can integrate with Firebase for authentication. We'll provide an example Node.js application
  below.
- A private key from the project's `Service Accounts` section via the
  [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk).
- A local Hasura DDN project.

:::

## Recipe

### Step 1. Add Firebase to your local application

#### Step 1.1 Add the firebase-admin package

Firebase works with a number of [languages and frameworks](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#add-sdk). In the
example(s) we show below, we'll use a Node.js application.

```sh
npm i firebase-admin
```

#### Step 1.2 Initialize firebase-admin

Then, initialize the module in your application:

```javascript
const admin = require("firebase-admin");

// service_account.json points to the private key from the prerequisites
admin.initializeApp({ credential: admin.credential.cert(require("./service_account.json")) });
```

#### Step 1.3 Add the custom claims

```javascript
// Here, you'll need to fetch the user's role from Hasura DDN using an admin-level authenticated request
// Learn more here: https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/auth/authentication/jwt/special-roles
// Below, we're hard-coding the value for now
const user_role = "user"; // the role returned from your request ☝️
const customClaims = {
  "claims.jwt.hasura.io": {
    "x-hasura-default-role": user_role,
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["user"],
    "x-hasura-user-id": decodedToken.uid,
  },
};

// Set custom claims for the user based on their uid
await admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(decodedToken.uid, customClaims);
```

This will add the required Hasura namespace with the keys that Hasura DDN expects when decoding a JWT. You can modify
the keys to suit your Hasura DDN [roles](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#typepermissions).

:::tip Custom claims

You can create any custom keys you wish and reference them in your permissions using session variables. Above,
`x-hasura-user-id` is simply an example. Any claim prefixed with `x-hasura-` is accessible to the Hasura DDN Engine. For
more information on which values are required, check the
[authorization docs](/auth/authentication/jwt/setup.mdx#step-2-create-the-claims).

:::

### Step 2. Update your AuthConfig

Update your AuthConfig object to use JWT mode and your
[Firebase JWKs](https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com) and audience:

```yaml
kind: AuthConfig
version: v2
definition:
  mode:
    jwt:
      audience: ["your-firebase-project-name"]
      claimsConfig:
        namespace:
          claimsFormat: Json
          location: "/claims.jwt.hasura.io"
      key:
        jwkFromUrl: "https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com"
      tokenLocation:
        type: Header
        name: Auth-Token
```

:::info Firebase JWKs

Firebase uses the same set of JWKs for all applications. It distinguishes between different apps by specifying the
audience (`aud`) claim in the JWT. Make sure to set the audience field to match your Firebase project name in the
AuthConfig object to ensure proper validation.

:::

Then, create a new build of your supergraph:

```sh
ddn supergraph build local
```

### Step 3. Test your configuration

Generate a new JWT by logging into your application. These values aren't typically displayed to users, so you'll need to
log them while in development. You can then add that value as a header in the console and test any permissions you have
in your metadata.

  <summary>Here's the complete sample Node.js server.</summary>

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const admin = require("firebase-admin");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const axios = require("axios");

// Initialize Firebase Admin SDK
admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert(require("./service_account.json")),
});

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Firebase API key from your Firebase project settings
const FIREBASE_API_KEY = "your API key found on the Firebase project's console";

// Route to handle user login with email and password
app.post("/login", async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;

  if (!email || !password) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: "Email and password are required" });
  }

  try {
    // Call Firebase REST API to sign in the user with email and password
    const response = await axios.post(
      `https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:signInWithPassword?key=${FIREBASE_API_KEY}`,
      {
        email,
        password,
        returnSecureToken: true,
      },
    );

    const { idToken } = response.data;

    // Verify the token using Firebase Admin SDK
    const decodedToken = await admin.auth().verifyIdToken(idToken);

    // Here, you'll need to fetch the user's role from Hasura DDN using an admin-level authenticated request
    // Learn more here: https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/auth/authentication/jwt/special-roles
    // Below, we're hard-coding the value for now
    const user_role = "user"; // the role returned from your request ☝️
    const customClaims = {
      "claims.jwt.hasura.io": {
        "x-hasura-default-role": user_role,
        "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["user"],
        "x-hasura-user-id": decodedToken.uid,
      },
    };

    // Set custom claims for the user based on their uid
    await admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(decodedToken.uid, customClaims);

    // Send the updated JWT back in the response
    res.status(200).json({
      idToken,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error logging in:", error.response?.data || error.message);
    res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid credentials", error: error.response?.data || error.message });
  }
});

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 4000");
});
```

</details>

## Wrapping up

In this guide, you learned how to integrate Firebase with Hasura DDN to create a secure and scalable identity management
solution using JWTs. By leveraging custom claims in conjunction with
[permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx), you can define precise access-control rules, ensuring that your
application remains secure and meets your users' needs.

As you continue building out your supergraph, keep in mind that authentication and authorization are crucial components.
Always validate your configuration and regularly test your setup to ensure it functions as expected across different
roles and environments.

If you encounter issues or need further customization, consider reviewing our related documentation or exploring
additional Firebase features that can enhance your authentication flows.
