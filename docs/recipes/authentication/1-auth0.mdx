# Auth0

## Introduction

In this recipe, you'll learn how to configure an existing [Auth0 application](https://auth0.com) and generate a JWT
which you can pass in the header of your requests to Hasura. After setting up your
[AuthConfig](/supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx) object to use JWT mode, this will allow you to validate users'
identities and create [permission rules](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx) which can limit access to underlying data
served by Hasura DDN.

:::info Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have:

- An Auth0 [application](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard).
- A local application that you're actively developing, built with any language or framework supported by
  [Auth0's SDKs](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries).
- A local Hasura DDN project.

:::

## Recipe

### Step 1. Create a new Auth0 Action

From your Auth0 application's dashboard, click `Action` in the sidenav and choose `Flows`.

Create a new `Login` flow and then choose the `Custom` option and click `Create Action` before entering a name for your
Action.

Then, modify the `onExecutePostLogin` function to the following:

```typescript
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const namespace = "claims.jwt.hasura.io";
  api.idToken.setCustomClaim(namespace, {
    "x-hasura-default-role": event.user.user_metadata.role,
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["user", "admin"],
    "x-hasura-user-id": event.user.user_id,
  });
};
```

This will add the required Hasura namespace with the keys that Hasura DDN expects when decoding a JWT. You can modify
the keys to suit your Hasura DDN [roles](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#typepermissions).

Click `Deploy`.

:::tip Custom claims

You can create any custom keys you wish and reference them in your permissions using session variables. Above,
`x-hasura-user-id` is simply an example. Any claim prefixed with `x-hasura-` is accessible to the Hasura DDN Engine. For
more information on which values are required, check the
[authorization docs](/auth/authentication/jwt/setup.mdx#step-2-create-the-claims).

### Step 2. Update your AuthConfig

Update your AuthConfig object to use JWT mode and your
[Auth0 JWKs](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-key-sets):

```yaml
kind: AuthConfig
version: v2
definition:
  mode:
    jwt:
      claimsConfig:
        namespace:
          claimsFormat: Json
          location: "/claims.jwt.hasura.io"
      issuer: "<your Auth0 tenant's URL>"
      key:
        jwkFromUrl: "https://<your Auth0 tennant's URL>/.well-known/jwks.json"
      tokenLocation:
        type: Header
        name: Auth-Token
```

Then, create a new build of your supergraph:

```sh
ddn supergraph build local
```

### Step 3. Test your configuration

Generate a new JWT by logging into your application. These values aren't typically displayed to users, so you'll need to
log them while in development. You can then add that value as a header in the console and test any permissions you have
in your metadata.

## Wrapping up

In this guide, you learned how to integrate Auth0 with Hasura DDN to create a secure and scalable identity management
solution using JWTs. By leveraging custom claims in conjunction with
[permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx), you can define precise access-control rules, ensuring that your
application remains secure and meets your users' needs.

As you continue building out your supergraph, keep in mind that authentication and authorization are crucial components.
Always validate your configuration and regularly test your setup to ensure it functions as expected across different
roles and environments.

If you encounter issues or need further customization, consider reviewing our related documentation or exploring
additional Auth0 features that can enhance your authentication flows.
