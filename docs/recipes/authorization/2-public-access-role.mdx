# Public Access

## Introduction

In this recipe, you'll learn how to configure [permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx) to allow for
unauthenticated access to data in your supergraph. This can be done by creating a role and setting the `filter` field to
`null`.

:::warning A word of caution

Any requests made to your supergraph with the configuration demonstrated below will have unauthenticated access to
whatever resources you allow. Use with caution!

:::

:::info Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have:

- A local Hasura DDN project.
- Either JWT or Webhook mode enabled in your [AuthConfig](/supergraph-modeling/auth-config.mdx).

:::

## Recipe

### Step 1. Create the claims

In your authentication server, you can provide a claims map that identifies the default role as `public`. This can be
any name you wish, so long as it's not a role (such as `admin`) that already exists.

```json title="E.g., a JWT claims configuration in an authentication service"

  "claims.jwt.hasura.io": {
    "x-hasura-default-role": "public",
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["public"],
  }
```

### Step 2. Update ModelPermissions {#step-two}

For whatever [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) you'd like to publicly expose, add a
[ModelPermissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#modelpermissions-modelpermissions) rule for the public role.

```yaml title="Example ModelPermission for an Events Model"
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Events
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
    #highlight-start
    - role: public
      select:
        filter: null
    #highlight-end
```

### Step 3. Update TypePermissions

Then, determine which [types](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx) you'd like to publicly expose by updating
[TypePermissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx#typepermissions-typepermissions). Hasura DDN gives you the
ability to granularly determine which fields from each Model are available to each role.

```yaml title="Example TypePermissions for an Events Model"
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: Events
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - id
          - owner_id
          - created_at
          - updated_at
          - is_live
          - title
          - date
          - description
    #highlight-start
    - role: public
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - id
          - is_live
          - title
          - date
          - description
    #highlight-end
```

### Step 4. Test your permissions

Create a new build of your supergraph:

```sh
ddn supergraph build local
```

Then, in a request, pass a header with the [role](#step-two) you identified earlier according to your authentication
configuration. You should see a schema limited to whatever ModelPermissions you defined for your new role and — when
executing a query — only see data meeting the filtering rule you included in the first step.

## Wrapping up

In this guide, you learned how to expose data in your supergraph to users without any authentication. This is valuable
for any public-facing resources clients may need to access.

As you continue building out your supergraph, keep in mind that authentication and authorization are crucial components.
Always validate your configuration and regularly test your setup to ensure it functions as expected across different
roles and environments.
