# Deploy connectors and supergraph independently

## Introduction

By default, the CLI command to build the supergraph, i.e. [ddn supergraph build create](/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build_create.mdx),
also builds the connectors required by the supergraph for convenience. Though in certain cases, you might want to do
these steps independently, e.g. when the connectors are self-hosted and not deployed on Hasura DDN.

In this recipe, you'll learn how to manage independent deployments for your connectors and the supergraph.

:::info Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have:

- A [local Hasura DDN project](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx).

:::

## Recipe

### Basics

The supergraph interacts with a connector via the [DataConnectorLink](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx)
metadata object which contains the NDC schema of the connector along with the URLs where the connector is running.

Hence, to independently manage the connector and supergraph deployments, we need to ensure that the corresponding
DataConnectorLink object is kept in sync with the connector.

### Step 1. Build the connector

Build and deploy your connector and note the:
- Read url, say `<deployed-connector-read-url>`
- Write url, say `<deployed-connector-write-url>`
- Authorization header, say `Bearer <deployed-connector-token>`

For example, to build the connector on DDN:

```bash title="Build connector on DDN using config at <subgraph-name>/connector/<connector-name>/connector.yaml"
ddn connector build create --connector <subgraph-name>/connector/<connector-name>/connector.yaml \
  --env-file .env.cloud \
  --project <project-name>
```

:::info

The `--project` and `--env-file` flags can be skipped if the keys `project` and `cloudEnvFile` are set in the context.

:::

### Step 2. Update connector URLs and Auth header in the data connector link

Update the environment variables that correspond to the connector read, write URLs and the Authorization header in the
data connector link:

```yaml title="For example: <subgraph-name>/metadata/<connector-link-name>.hml"
kind: DataConnectorLink
version: v1
definition:
  name: <connector-link-name>
  #highlight-start
  url:
    readWriteUrls:
      read:
        valueFromEnv: <CONNECTOR>_READ_URL
      write:
        valueFromEnv: <CONNECTOR>_WRITE_URL
  headers:
    Authorization:
      valueFromEnv: <CONNECTOR>_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER
  #highlight-end
  schema:
    ...
```

Update the environment variables in the corresponding env file:

```env title="For example: .env.cloud"
...
#highlight-start
<CONNECTOR>_READ_URL="<deployed-connector-read-url>"
<CONNECTOR>_WRITE_URL="<deployed-connector-write-url>"
<CONNECTOR>_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER="Bearer <deployed-connector-token>"
#highlight-end
...
```

### Step 3. Build the supergraph without connectors

Build the supergraph to get a supergraph build using the connector deployed above:

```bash title="Create supergraph build on DDN without building the related connectors:"
#highlight-start
ddn supergraph build create --no-build-connectors \
#highlight-end
  --supergraph supergraph.yaml \
  --env-file .env.cloud \
  --project <project-name>
```

:::info

The `--project`, `--supergraph` and `--env-file` flags can be skipped if the keys `project`, `supergraph` and
`cloudEnvFile` are set in the context.

:::

### Step 4. (Optional) Add a custom script to build the supergraph

You can add the above command as a [custom script](/project-configuration/custom-scripts.mdx) to avoid having to pass
the `--no-build-connectors` flag each time.

For example, you can update your context config to the following:

```yaml title="<project-root>/.hasura/context.yaml:"
kind: Context
version: v3
definition:
  current: default
  contexts:
    default: ...
  scripts:
    docker-start:
      bash: HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat) docker compose --env-file .env up --build --pull always -d
      powershell: $Env:HASURA_DDN_PAT = (ddn auth print-pat); docker compose --env-file .env up --build --pull always -d
    #highlight-start
    build-supergraph:
      bash: ddn supergraph build create --no-build-connectors --supergraph supergraph.yaml --env-file .env.cloud --project <project-name>
      powershell: ddn supergraph build create --no-build-connectors --supergraph supergraph.yaml --env-file .env.cloud --project <project-name>
    #highlight-end
```

Now you can run the following command to build the supergraph:

```bash
ddn run build-supergraph
```

:::info

The `--project`, `--supergraph` and `--env-file` flags can be skipped if the keys `project`, `supergraph` and
`cloudEnvFile` are set in the context.
