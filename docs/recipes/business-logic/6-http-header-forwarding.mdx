# HTTP Header Forwarding

## Introduction

Hasura DDN can be configured to forward HTTP request headers to functions implemented in a lambda connector. It can also
be configured to respond to HTTP requests involving the lambda connector with HTTP headers returned by functions in the
lambda connector.

:::info Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have:

- A [local Hasura DDN project](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx).
- A [lambda connector](/business-logic/overview.mdx) added to your project.

:::

## Recipe - Receiving HTTP request headers

To configure your functions to receive HTTP request headers, perform the following steps:

### Step 1. Add a `headers` function parameter

First, you should modify all functions that you want to receive HTTP request headers and add a `headers` function
parameter, like so:

<Tabs className="language-tabs">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```typescript title="An example hello function in your functions.ts, updated with a headers parameter"
    import * as sdk from "@hasura/ndc-lambda-sdk";

    /** @readonly */
    export function hello(headers: sdk.JSONValue, name?: string): string {
      const headersMap = headers.value as Record<string, string>;
      return `hello ${name ?? "world"}`;
    }
    ```

    The `headers` function parameter will be passed as a JSON object that represents the HTTP request headers. To extract it, we cast the `headers.value` property to the `Record<string, string>` type.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    Support coming soon!
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    Support coming soon!
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

You don't need to call the function parameter `headers`. You can use any name you wish, but it must be the same name
across all functions and it must always be used to receive HTTP headers.

:::

### Step 2. Update the metadata

Next, we need to re-introspect the connector given that we just changed the definition of our functions.

```bash title="Introspect the connector"
ddn connector introspect my_ts
```

Then, we need to open the HML file that contains the `DataConnectorLink` metadata object for the connector (usually
found in `<subgraph name>/metadata/<connector name>.hml`) and edit it.

We use [argument presets](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx#dataconnectorlink-dataconnectorargumentpreset)
to automatically set our `headers` function parameters with the HTTP request headers. Below is an example where we
forward the `X-Test-Header` header to the connector. **Keep in mind that only headers listed here are forwarded to the
connector.**

```yaml title=my_ts.hml
kind: DataConnectorLink
version: v1
definition:
  name: my_ts
  url:
    readWriteUrls:
      read:
        valueFromEnv: MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_TS_READ_URL
      write:
        valueFromEnv: MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_TS_WRITE_URL
  headers:
    Authorization:
      valueFromEnv: MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_TS_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER
  # highlight-start
  argumentPresets:
    - argument: headers
      value:
        httpHeaders:
          forward:
            - X-Test-Header
          additional: {}
  # highlight-end
  schema: ...
```

### Step 3. Create a new API build and test

Now, we can rebuild the supergraph and test our changes:

```bash title="Run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

:::warning `headers` already mapped error

If you get a build error saying "the argument headers is mapped to the data connector argument headers which is already
used as an argument preset in the DataConnectorLink" then you need to open HML file containing the `Command` mentioned
in the error and remove the headers argument from the `Command`'s `arguments` list and from the `argumentMapping`, if it
exists.

This is because when you preset arguments in your `DataConnectorLink`, they are automatically set by the DDN engine and
therefore are not defined on the `Command` as arguments that API users can set.

:::

:::tip Start your engines!

Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine using the following command.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn run docker-start
```

This reads the `docker-start` script from the context config at `.hasura/context.yaml` and starts your Hasura engine,
any connectors, and observability tools.

:::

Launch the Hasura console to see and test your GraphQL API using:

```bash title="Run:"
ddn console --local
```

## Recipe - Returning HTTP response headers

To configure your lambda connector to return HTTP response headers, perform the following steps:

### Step 1. Modify the function return type

First, you should add a helper type that you can re-use that will contain your headers as well as the actual value you
want to return from your function:

<Tabs className="language-tabs">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```typescript title="In your functions.ts, add the following"
    type HeadersResponse<T> = {
      headers: sdk.JSONValue
      response: T
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    Support coming soon!
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    Support coming soon!
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

Then, you can modify your function return value to use this type. In the following example, we take the headers received
in the previous section and add an additional header `X-Test-ResponseHeader` to be returned on the response. We then
return that, as well as our response string, inside our new `HeadersResponse` object.

<Tabs className="language-tabs">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    ```typescript title="An example hello function in your functions.ts, updated to return a HeadersResponse type"
    /** @readonly */
    export function hello(headers: sdk.JSONValue, name?: string): HeadersResponse<string> {
      const headersMap = headers.value as Record<string, string>;
      headersMap["X-Test-ResponseHeader"] = "I set this in the code";
      return {
        headers: new sdk.JSONValue(headersMap),
        response: `hello ${name ?? "world"}`
      };
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    Support coming soon!
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    Support coming soon!
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Step 2. Update the metadata

Next, we need to re-introspect the connector given that we just changed the definition of our functions.

```bash title="Introspect the connector"
ddn connector introspect my_ts
```

Then, we need to open the HML file that contains the `DataConnectorLink` metadata object for the connector (usually
found in `<subgraph name>/metadata/<connector name>.hml`) and edit it.

We will be using the
[`responseHeaders` configuration property](/supergraph-modeling/data-connector-links.mdx#dataconnectorlink-responseheaders)
to configure which headers returned by our connector functions we want returned as a part of our HTTP response headers.
In the below example, the `X-Test-Header` and `X-Test-ResponseHeader` headers are listed under `forwardHeaders` to
ensure they are added to the HTTP response if they are returned by the connector function. We also set the
`headersField` and `resultField` properties to the two property names we defined on the `HeadersResponse` type we
defined earlier.

```yml title=my_ts.hml
kind: DataConnectorLink
version: v1
definition:
  name: my_ts
  url:
    readWriteUrls:
      read:
        valueFromEnv: MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_TS_READ_URL
      write:
        valueFromEnv: MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_TS_WRITE_URL
  headers:
    Authorization:
      valueFromEnv: MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_TS_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER
  argumentPresets:
    - argument: headers
      value:
        httpHeaders:
          forward:
            - X-Test-Header
          additional: {}
  # highlight-start
  responseHeaders:
    headersField: headers
    resultField: response
    forwardHeaders:
      - X-Test-Header
      - X-Test-ResponseHeader
  # highlight-end
  schema: ...
```

### Step 3. Create a new API build and test

Now, we can rebuild the supergraph and test our changes:

```bash title="Run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

:::warning type is not defined in the agent schema error

The [`outputType`](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx#command-commandv1) of `Command`s that represent our functions
should be the [OpenDD Scalar Type](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx) used to represent type of the
`HeadersResponse.response` property, not the `HeadersResponse` type itself.

So, using our above example, the `Hello` `Command`'s `outputType` should be `String!`, not `HeaderResponseString!`. If
it is incorrectly configured, you may get a build error such as "NDC validation error: type String is not defined in the
agent schema".

:::

:::tip Start your engines!

Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine using the following command.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
ddn run docker-start
```

This reads the `docker-start` script from the context config at `.hasura/context.yaml` and starts your Hasura engine,
any connectors, and observability tools.
