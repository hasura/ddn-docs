# Enrich data with LLMs

## Introduction

In this recipe, you'll learn how to interact with OpenAI's API to send prompts and receive responses. This can be used
to integrate AI-driven features, such as generating text or completing tasks, into your API. In the example below, we'll
hard-code a prompt and have OpenAI apply it to existing content in our supergraph.

:::info Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have:

- A [local Hasura DDN project](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx).
- A [lambda connector](/business-logic/overview.mdx) added to your project.
- An OpenAI API key (You can get one by signing up at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup)).

## Recipe

### Step 1. Write the function

<Tabs className="language-tabs">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

    ```sh title="In your connector's directory, install the OpenAI package:"
    npm install openai
    ```

    ```typescript title="In your functions.ts file, add the following:"
    // We can store this in the project's .env file and reference it here
    const OPENAI_API_KEY =
      "your_openai_api_key";

    const client = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY,
    });

    /**
    * @readonly
    */
    export async function generateSeoDescription(input: string): Promise<string | null> {
      const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
        messages: [
          {
            role: "system",
            content:
              "You are a senior marketing associate. Take the product description provided and improve upon it to rank well with SEO.",
          },
          { role: "user", content: input },
        ],
        model: "gpt-4o",
      });

      return response.choices[0].message.content;
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

    ```plaintext title="In your connector's directory, add the OpenAI Python client package to your requirements.txt:"
    openai==1.46.1
    ```

    ```python title="In your functions.py file, add the following:"
    from hasura_ndc import start
    from hasura_ndc.function_connector import FunctionConnector
    from openai import OpenAI

    connector = FunctionConnector()

    # We can store this in the project's .env file and referene it here
    OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
    client = OpenAI(
        api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    )

    @connector.register_query
    def generate_seo_description(input: str) -> str:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a senior marketing associate. Take the product description provided and improve upon it to rank well with SEO."},
                {"role": "user", "content": input}
            ],
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        start(connector)
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">

    ```go title="In a Go file inside your functions directory, add the following:"
    package functions

    import (
      "bytes"
      "context"
      "encoding/json"
      "fmt"
      "io/ioutil"
      "net/http"

      "hasura-ndc.dev/ndc-go/types"
    )

    type SEOArguments struct {
      Input string `json:"input"`
    }

    // OpenAIRequest represents the request payload for OpenAI's Chat API
    type OpenAIRequest struct {
      Model    string    `json:"model"`
      Messages []Message `json:"messages"`
    }

    // Message defines the structure for messages sent to OpenAI
    type Message struct {
      Role    string `json:"role"`
      Content string `json:"content"`
    }

    // OpenAIResponse represents the response from OpenAI
    type OpenAIResponse struct {
      Choices []struct {
        Message struct {
          Content string `json:"content"`
        } `json:"message"`
      } `json:"choices"`
    }

    // GenerateSeoDescription sends a request to OpenAI and generates an SEO-optimized product description
    func FunctionGenerateSeoDescription(ctx context.Context, state *types.State, arguments *SEOArguments) (string, error) {
      // We can store this in the project's .env file and reference it here
      apiKey := "your_openai_api_key"

      // Prepare the request payload
      reqBody, _ := json.Marshal(OpenAIRequest{
        Model: "gpt-4",
        Messages: []Message{
          {Role: "system", Content: "You are a senior marketing associate. Take the product description provided and improve upon it to rank well with SEO."},
          {Role: "user", Content: arguments.Input},
        },
      })

      // Create a new request to the OpenAI Chat API
      req, _ := http.NewRequest("POST", "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", bytes.NewBuffer(reqBody))
      req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
      req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer "+apiKey)

      client := &http.Client{}
      resp, err := client.Do(req)
      if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to send request: %v", err)
      }
      defer resp.Body.Close()

      // Parse the response from OpenAI
      body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
      var openAIResp OpenAIResponse
      json.Unmarshal(body, &openAIResp)

      return openAIResp.Choices[0].Message.Content, nil
    }
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Track your function

To add your function, generate the related metadata that will link together any functions in your lambda connector's
source files and your API:

```bash
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

Then, you can generate an `hml` file for the function using the following command:

```bash
ddn command add <connector_name> "*"
```

### Step 3. Create a relationship (optional)

Assuming the input argument's type matches that of a type belonging to one or more of your models, you can create a
relationship to the command. This will enable you to make nested queries that will invoke your custom business logic
using the value of the field from the related model!

Create a relationship in the corresponding model's HML file.

```yaml title="For example, if we have a Prompts model:"
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  name: optimizedDescription
  sourceType: Products
  target:
    command:
      name: generateSeoDescription
  mapping:
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: description
      target:
        argument:
          argumentName: input
```

### Step 4. Test your function

Create a new build of your supergraph:

```sh
ddn supergraph build local
```

In your project's explorer, you should see the new function exposed as a type and should be able to make a query like
this:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query SimpleOpenAIQuery {
  generateSeoDescription(input: "A cool, red hat.")
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "generateSeoDescription": "Experience ultimate style and comfort with our vibrant, cherry-red hat. This top-rated, trendy headwear is designed with exceptional quality, ensuring it's not only a fashion statement but also functional. Perfect for all seasons, our stylish red hat will match any outfit and can ignite any look with a pop of color. Ideal for casual wear or special occasions, this must-have accessory is an addition worth making to your wardrobe. Stand out in the crowd and express your personality with our aesthetically pleasing, durable, and unique red hat."
  }
}`}
/>

If you created a relationship, you can make a query like this, too:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query ProductsWithOptimizedDescriptions {
  products {
    id
    description
    optimizedDescription
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "products": [
