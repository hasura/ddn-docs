# Data Plane

Hasura v3 Engine and the Data Connectors are running on the Data Plane. 
The DDN Data Plane runs an enhanced version of v3 engine which is capable
of serving multiple GraphQL APIs at the same time. It is a serverless-like
runtime where the configuration for executing a GraphQL request is loaded
on demand and is discarded after processing the request. This makes the
runtime extremely efficient and highly scalable.
Certain connectors also makes use of similar strategies to efficiently
handle connection pools, only creating them on demand.

Data Plane can be deployed on as many regions as needed and API requests
can be routed to the nearest one to the client for lowest latency possible
using advanced load balancing settings utilizing Anycast IP addresses.
This is availabile out of the box on GCP, AWS and Azure and can be deployed
on self-hosted Private DDN if the network capabilities of the infrastructure
allows it.

## Interactions with Control Plane

In Self-Hosted Private DDN, the data plane running on the customer's infrastructure
communicates with the control plane only in very specific scenarios.

1. Fetch GraphQL build artifacts
2. Fetch connector build artifacts
3. Send Metrics and Traces
4. Send operational telemetry

Customer data never leaves the data plane. The control plane does not have a direct
link to data plane. Rather, it is the data plane that always reaches out to control
plane.
