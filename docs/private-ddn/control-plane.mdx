# Control Plane

Developers interact with the Hasura DDN Control Plane to create supergraph builds.
Each supergraph build produces a unique GraphQL API, hosted by the Data Plane.
As a developer, you use the Console on the Control Plane to visualise the
supergraph and try out GraphQL APIs. Control Plane also provides monitoring and
observability features. The Console let's you add collaborators so that you can
invite other developers to contribute to the supergraph and also to share the 
GraphQL API with consumers.

Control Plane enables preview deployments (also called builds) by accepting your
project metadata and making it available to the Data Plane in a format optimized
for the Hasura v3 Engine runtime. Each build you create will give a unique GraphQL
API that can be used to execute operations independently without affecting any
other builds.

Data Plane sends observability data to the Control Plane which then processes it 
and makes it available for consumption on the Console. This includes traces for 
every GraphQL opeation you execute and overall metrics on the API usage.
