# Architecture

When you sign up and create a project on Hasura DDN, your
GraphQL API is running on global edge infrastructure hosted
by Hasura. You configure Hasura to talk to your databases,
APIs or other connectors that are hosted on your infrastructure
and Hasura communicates with them over the public internet.

## Private DDN

With Private DDN, you get to run Hasura and your connectors either on 
dedicated infrastructure hosted by Hasura or on your own infrastructure.
Private DDN offers enhanced security and isolation by enabling private
connectivity for your databases, APIs and other connectors. Hasura will
be able to talk to your sources over dedicated network, bypassing the
public internet.
