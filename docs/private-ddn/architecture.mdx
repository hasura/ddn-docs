# Architecture

Compared to Hasura v2, a fundamental architecture improvement was bought into 
Hasura v3 where the "build-time" and "run-time" are separated into distinct 
components. The [Control Plane](./control-plane.mdx) builds the project's 
metadata and makes it available for the Hasura v3 engine running on the 
[Data Plane](./data-plane.mdx).

When you sign up and create a project on Hasura DDN, your
GraphQL API is running on global edge infrastructure hosted
by Hasura. You configure Hasura to talk to your databases,
APIs or other connectors that are hosted on your infrastructure
and Hasura communicates with them over the public internet.

## Private DDN

With Private DDN, you get to run Hasura and your connectors either on 
dedicated infrastructure hosted by Hasura or on your own infrastructure.
Private DDN offers enhanced security and isolation by enabling private
connectivity for your databases, APIs and other connectors. Hasura will
be able to talk to your sources over dedicated private network, bypassing the
public internet.

### Private DDN (Hasura Hosted)

Hasura Hosted Private DDN is available on GCP, AWS and Azure and can be 
deployed to any region of your choice. Multiple regions can be choosen to
setup a distributed edge configuration to provide lowest possible latency
to your clients. Hasura manages the deployment, uptime and availability
of the data plane for you.

Since the data plane is running on a dedicated and isolated compute and network
infrastructure, Private DDN provides enhanced security and compliance for 
your workloads. Private network connectivity is available over VPC Network 
Peering, Private Link / Private Service Connect, Transit Gateway or any other 
equivalent connectivity option provided by the cloud provider.

Please reach out to us if you need support for another cloud or configuration
that is not mentioned here.

### Private DDN (Self Hosted)

Private DDN is also available to self-host if you need to have complete control over
the infrastructure. The data plane is running on a Kubernetes cluster of your choice
and you control the uptime, upgrades etc. All API traffic stays within your network 
and does not leave the boundaries fo your system.

Do note that a Kubernetes cluster is required to run the data plane and it is a 
sufficiently complex system that requires advanced knowledge of Kubernetes
operations.
