## 1. Hasura
Hasura is an open-source engine that gives you instant GraphQL APIs on your databases. It connects to your databases and
auto-generates a GraphQL API based on your database schema. Hasura V3 is the latest version of the Hasura engine,
offering enhanced features and performance improvements.

## 2. Metadata
Metadata in Hasura V3 refers to the configuration that defines the structure and behavior of your GraphQL API. It
includes information about tables, relationships, permissions, event triggers, and more. The metadata is stored in a
declarative format and is used by the Hasura engine to generate the GraphQL API.

## 3. API Authoring
API authoring in Hasura V3 refers to the process of defining and configuring your GraphQL API using the metadata. It
involves specifying tables, relationships, permissions, and other aspects of your API to meet your application's
requirements.

## 4. Open Data Domain Specification (ODDS)
The Open Data Domain Specification (ODDS) is the revised and concretized GraphQL Data specification introduced in
Hasura V3. It dictates the metadata structure that the Hasura runtime engine accepts. ODDS provides a standardized way
to define and organize your API configurations.

## 5. Hasura CLI
The Hasura CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with Hasura V3 from your terminal. It provides
commands for managing metadata, deploying changes, and performing various administrative tasks. The CLI is an essential
tool for developers working with Hasura V3.

## 6. Hasura Console
The Hasura Console is a web-based user interface that provides a visual representation of your GraphQL API and metadata.
It allows you to explore and interact with your API, manage metadata, and perform administrative tasks. The Console
offers a user-friendly experience for developers working with Hasura V3.

## 7. Namespaces
Namespaces in Hasura V3 are logical containers that allow you to group and isolate API configurations. They help avoid naming conflicts and enable customization within the Hasura ecosystem. Namespaces provide a way to organize and manage your API resources in a collaborative environment.

## 8. Metadata Environments
Metadata environments in Hasura V3 are isolated environments within a project where you can work on specific sets of metadata and configurations. Each environment can have its own secrets and configurations, allowing developers to work independently without interfering with others.
