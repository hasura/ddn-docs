# Hasura Glossary

## Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD Spec)
A standardized specification that defines the metadata structure for APIs in Hasura v3. The OpenDD Spec includes typed
metadata objects like data domains, types, models, commands, data sources, and API configurations.

## Data Connectors:
A framework in Hasura v3 that allows developers to create custom data connector agents to integrate Hasura with
various external data sources, databases, and services.

## Model
A metadata object in Hasura v3 that defines the structure of a data source. Learn [more](/data-domain-modeling/models.mdx).

## Relationships
A metadata object in Hasura v3 that defines the relationship between two models. Learn [more](/data-domain-modeling/relationships.mdx).

## Plugins
A mechanism in Hasura v3 that allows developers to extend the functionality of Hasura by adding custom logic to the
GraphQL engine. Plugins can be used to add custom authentication, authorization, and other custom logic.

## Metadata Build Service
A service in Hasura v3 which introspects data sources and can generate the corresponding metadata.

## LSP
The Hasura (LSP) Language Server Protocol is a protocol that enables the integration of language features like
autocomplete, we have built this into a
[VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) which you can download here to
help you write metadata.

## Data Sources
Any external data source, database, or service that can be connected to Hasura v3 using a Data Connector agent.
Learn [more](/data-domain-modeling/data-source.mdx).

## Metadata Modules
A mechanism in Hasura v3 that allows metadata to be organized into typed JSON files within collections, enhancing
the organization, version control, and collaboration abilities of metadata.

## Data Domains
In Hasura v3, data domains provide autonomy to teams for updating project metadata and allow them to organize and
structure metadata as per team and business requirements.

## Serverless Runtime System
The refactored runtime engine in Hasura v3 that fetches metadata on a per-request basis, enabling isolation and improved
scalability. It eliminates shared state and cold start issues for enhanced performance.

## Data Delivery Network (DDN)
An edge network in Hasura v3 that ensures low-latency, high-performance APIs globally. It enhances API performance
for users across different regions.

## Hasura Secure Connect
A feature in Hasura v3 that creates secure tunnels to connect with local resources, aiding local development while
ensuring data security.

## Hasura Console
An interface in Hasura v3 that provides tools for metadata authoring, testing, deployment, and collaboration. It
offers an enhanced metadata editor and viewer to streamline API development.

## Push-Down Capabilities
The ability in Hasura v3 to delegate certain query operations to the underlying data source, improving query
optimization and performance.

## Hasura CLI (Command-Line Interface)
A tool in Hasura v3 that enables developers to interact with Hasura from the command line. It supports various
commands for creating builds, deploying projects, creating tunnels and managing metadata. Learn [more](/ci-cd/hasura-cli.mdx).

## Metadata Authoring
The process of defining and creating metadata files using the OpenDD Spec in Hasura v3. It involves specifying data
types, models, commands, data sources, and API configurations. Learn [more](/data-domain-modeling/overview.mdx).

## Edge Caching
A caching mechanism in Hasura v3 that caches frequently accessed data at the edge of the network, reducing latency
and improving response times for end-users.
