# Getting Started with v3
This document will help you get started with Hasura v3 using the new CLI. Please ensure you have installed the CLI ([installation guide](https://github.com/hasura/v3-cli/blob/main/README.md)).

## Introduction
This document walks you through creating a new Hasura V3 project and its development loop. You'll get to use the newly introduced Build System and the Secure Connect Tunnel System.

## Step 1: Log into Hasura Cloud
1. Goto [Hasura Cloud Settings](https://cloud.hasura.io/account-settings/access-tokens) to generate a token for the CLI
2. Use the command `hasura3 cloud login --pat ${your-access-token}` to add the token to the CLI (login)

## Step 2: Create a local project
Each project in the cloud will have a corresponding local project that will be used for development. This local project only contains the Hasura Metadata file that follows the new [Metadata Spec](https://github.com/hasura/open-data-domain-specification), and can be a `.yaml` or a `.json` file. This file can be checked into version control along with other files (if any) of your project and can be shared.

To create a new local project, use the command `hasura3 local init --dir ${project-directory}` and pass the directory where you want to create the metadata file as an argument. This command will create a `metadata.yaml` file by default. Use `hasura3 local init --help` to see all supported operations.

## Step 3: Create a cloud project
Create a corresponding project on Hasura Cloud using `hasura3 cloud project create`. Use `hasura3 cloud project --help` to see all supported operations on cloud projects.

## Step 4: Connect your local database to Hasura Cloud using Secure Connect Tunnel
The Secure Connect Tunnel System is a new feature exclusive to Hasura v3 designed to allow users to be able to connect their local databases to Hasura Cloud. To see all Tunnel operations, use `hasura3 cloud tunnel --help`.

To create a Tunnel:

1. Start a Postgres Database (you can use the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres))
2. Start the Secure Connect Tunnel Daemon using the `hasura3 local tunnel daemon start`.
3. Create a new Tunnel using the command `hasura3 cloud tunnel create ${postgres-url}`. You'll get the Tunnel URL in the result of this command. You will use this URL in your Metadata.

## Step 5: Author Metadata
Hasura v3 has a new Metadata format that can found in this [spec](https://github.com/hasura/open-data-domain-specification). Use the Tunnel URL you got in the previous step as the database URL.

## Step 6: Set Secrets
Secrets are variables, that store sensitive information. It may be helpful to think of Secrets as environment vairables, though they are not exactly the same. Sensitive data in your metadata can be masked using Secrets. Use `hasura3 cloud secret create` to create a new secret. Use `hasura3 cloud secret --help` to see all available commands for secrets.

## Step 7: Create a Build
`Build` is another new feature introduced in Hasura v3. A `Build` is an immutable, fully functioning GraphQL API that represents a milestone in your development cycle. It maybe helpful to think of builds as git commits. Since each Build results in a fully functioning GraphQL API that is deployed on Hasura Cloud, and it can be shared with other users. Each Build is completely independent. One project can have multiple Builds, out of which, one is applied to production. This workflow allows for easier rollbacks on production, and greater collaboration during development.

Create a build using `hasura3 cloud build create --project-id $project-id --metadata-file $metadata-file`. You'll get a Build Version, ID and a GraphQL API Endpoint as the result of this command. Try out that GraphQL API and see that it's working exactly like a deployed project would. Also, going to your project console, you'll notice that while there is a Build created, there is no Build applied. We'll do that in the next step. 

## Step 8: Apply the Build
Once you are staisfied with a Build, you can 'Apply' it. Applying a Build is akin to pushing a git commit to production. Once a Build is Applied, your public GraphQL API starts pointing to that.

To Apply a Build, use the commnad `hasura3 cloud build apply --project-id $project-id --build-id $build-id`.
