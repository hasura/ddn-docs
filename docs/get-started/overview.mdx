## Create Cloud Project

Use the Hasura CLI to create a new cloud project by running the command: hasura create project {project-name}.
This command will create a new project in the Hasura cloud environment.

## Connect Local Resources

Connect your local development environment to your cloud project by running the command: hasura login.
Follow the prompts to authenticate and link your local resources to the cloud project.

## Set Secrets

Set up secrets for your project to securely store sensitive information.
Use the CLI command: hasura secrets apply to apply the secrets to your project.

## Connect Data Source (or Provide dummy data source)

Connect your data source to your Hasura project using the CLI command: hasura connect data-source {data-source-name}.
Alternatively, you can provide a dummy data source for testing purposes.

## Browse Models and Fields

Once your data source is connected, you can browse the models and fields in your project.
Use the Hasura Console or CLI commands to explore and manage your data models.

## Create Build

Create a build for your project using the CLI command: hasura create build {build-name}.
This will generate a build based on your project configuration.

## Test Build API

Test the build API to ensure everything is working correctly.
Use the CLI command: hasura test build {build-name} to run tests on the build API.

## Apply Build

Apply the build to your project using the CLI command: hasura apply build {build-name}.
This will deploy the build and make it available for use.

## Test Project API

Test the project API to verify that your application is functioning as expected.
Use tools like Postman or GraphQL clients to interact with the project API endpoints.

Congratulations! You have successfully started with Hasura V3 and are now ready to build amazing applications.
