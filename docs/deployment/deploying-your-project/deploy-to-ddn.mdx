# Deploying your project to Hasura DDN

Deploying your project to Hasura DDN is a simple process and can be done in 3 steps.

## Deployment flow

1. Initialize a project on Hasura DDN.
2. Create a supergraph build on Hasura DDN.
3. Apply the supergraph build to your project on Hasura DDN.

### Step 1: Create a project on Hasura DDN

```bash title="Initialize a project on Hasura DDN"
ddn project init
```

You can optionally also append a project name to this command.

The CLI will respond with the project name, the subgraph(s) and env file which were created, and a hint to create a
supergraph build.

```text title="Example output"
9:42AM INF Using Supergraph config file "supergraph.yaml" found in context.
9:42AM INF Project "alive-corgi-5690" created on Hasura DDN successfully
9:42AM INF Subgraph "globals" created on Project "alive-corgi-5690" successfully
9:42AM INF Subgraph "app" created on Project "alive-corgi-5690" successfully
9:42AM INF Using localEnvFile ".env" found in context.
9:42AM INF env file ".env.cloud" created successfully
9:42AM INF Project "alive-corgi-5690" set in context
9:42AM INF CloudEnvFile set as ".env.cloud" in context
+-----------+------------------+
| Project   | alive-corgi-5690 |
+-----------+------------------+
| Subgraphs | globals,app      |
+-----------+------------------+
HINT Create a SupergraphBuild on the DDN project: ddn supergraph build create
```

You now have a project on Hasura DDN with the same subgraphs as you have locally. Currently, the subgraphs are empty.

:::info Create vs Initialize

The `ddn project init` command is similar to `ddn project create` but it also creates the subgraphs and env file for
you. `ddn project create` will only create an empty project and you will need to create the DDN project subgraphs and
local `.env.cloud` file yourself.

:::

### Step 2: Create a supergraph build on Hasura DDN

```bash
ddn supergraph build create
```

This command will create builds for each subgraph, each connector in those subgraphs, and the supergraph. Each of these
can be built independently but this command will create them all.

```text title="Example output"
9:49AM INF Using Supergraph config file "supergraph.yaml" found in context.
9:49AM INF Using Project "alive-corgi-5690" found in context.
9:49AM INF Using cloudEnvFile ".env.cloud" found in context.
9:49AM INF Using Target env file ".env.cloud" found in context.
9:49AM INF Building Connector "my_connector" in Subgraph "app"
9:49AM INF The connector "my_connector" can be secured by setting a secret to the environment variable "APP_MY_CONNECTOR_HASURA_SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET" which maps to "HASURA_SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET". Since no secret was provided, we will generate a random secret to secure the connector.
9:49AM INF ConnectorBuild ID: "eb1540f9-7e99-4ea8-9a9c-7d19e55e0c87"
9:50AM INF Connector "my_connector" in Subgraph "app" built successfully with ID "eb1540f9-7e99-4ea8-9a9c-7d19e55e0c87"
9:50AM INF DataConnectorLink "my_connector" already upto date
9:50AM INF Updated env file for Subgraph "app"
9:50AM INF SupergraphBuild created on Hasura DDN successfully

9:50AM INF GraphQL schema diff feature is not available for the project's current plan. Continuing...
HINT Explore SupergraphBuild on the DDN console: ddn console --build-version 85b0961544
```

You can now use the console to explore the supergraph build.

This build is still not the "official" applied API for the project.

### Step 3: Apply the supergraph build to your project

```bash
ddn supergraph build apply <build-version>
```

eg:

```bash
ddn supergraph build apply 85b0961544
```

This build is now the "official" applied API for the project and is accessible via the API URL in the output of the
command or via the console.

```text title="Example output"
9:52AM INF Using Project "alive-corgi-5690" found in context.
9:52AM INF GraphQL schema diff feature is not available for the project's current plan. Continuing...

```
