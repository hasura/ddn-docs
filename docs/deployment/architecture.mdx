# Architecture

Compared to Hasura v2, a fundamental architecture improvement was bought into 
Hasura v3 where the "build-time" and "run-time" are separated into distinct 
components. The [Control Plane](#control-plane) builds the project's 
metadata and makes it available for the Hasura v3 engine running on the 
[Data Plane](#data-plane).

## Control Plane

Developers interact with the Hasura DDN Control Plane to create supergraph builds.
Each supergraph build produces a unique GraphQL API, hosted by the Data Plane.
As a developer, you use the Console on the Control Plane to visualise the
supergraph and try out GraphQL APIs. Control Plane also provides monitoring and
observability features. The Console let's you add collaborators so that you can
invite other developers to contribute to the supergraph and also to share the 
GraphQL API with consumers.


Control Plane enables preview deployments (also called builds) by accepting your
project metadata and making it available to the Data Plane in a format optimized
for the Hasura v3 Engine runtime. Each build you create will give a unique GraphQL
API that can be used to execute operations independently without affecting any
other builds.

Data Plane sends observability data to the Control Plane which then processes it 
and makes it available for consumption on the Console. This includes traces for 
every GraphQL opeation you execute and overall metrics on the API usage.

## Data Plane

Hasura v3 Engine and the Data Connectors are running on the Data Plane. 
The DDN Data Plane runs an enhanced version of v3 engine which is capable
of serving multiple GraphQL APIs at the same time. It is a serverless-like
runtime where the configuration for executing a GraphQL request is loaded
on demand and is discarded after processing the request. This makes the
runtime extremely efficient and highly scalable.
Certain connectors also makes use of similar strategies to efficiently
handle connection pools, only creating them on demand.

Data Plane can be deployed on as many regions as needed and API requests
can be routed to the nearest one to the client for lowest latency possible
using advanced load balancing settings utilizing Anycast IP addresses.
This is availabile out of the box on GCP, AWS and Azure and can be deployed
on self-hosted Private DDN if the network capabilities of the infrastructure
allows it.
