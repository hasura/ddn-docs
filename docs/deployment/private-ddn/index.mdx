# Hasura Private DDN

To deploy a supergraph to Hasura Private DDN, you first need to have a Data Plane created. When you onboard as a
customer, a Data Plane would have been provisioned for you by the Hasura team and the details will be shared with you.

You can find all the Data Planes you have access to on this page: https://console.hasura.io/data-plane

To create a project, you need to be added as a collaborator to a data plane. Follow the steps at
[Data Plane collaboration](/deployment/private-ddn/data-plane-collaboration.mdx) to add other users.

Once collaborators are added, they can create projects using the following command:

```
ddn project create --data-plane-id <data-plane-id> --plan <plan>
```

After project creation, the steps are exactly the same as deploying to DDN. Follow the docs
[to create subgraphs](/deployment/deploying-your-project/tutorial/02-create-a-subgraph.mdx) and continue to deploy.
