# How to Create a Project on a Data Plane

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the steps for creating a project on a Private Hasura DDN Data Plane. Before proceeding,
you'll first need to be [invited](/deployment/private-ddn/data-plane-collaboration.mdx) to a Data Plane.

<Prereqs />

## Step 1. Initialize a local project

```sh title="Being by authenticating your CLI seession:"
ddn auth login
```

A browser window will open and prompt you for your login credentials. After successfully logging in, you'll be able to
return to the CLI.

```sh title="Next, creat a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init <project_name> && cd <project_name>
```

The DDN CLI will scaffold out all the necessary files and directories for your project.

## Step 2. Retrieve your Data Plane ID

You can find all the Data Planes you have access to on this page: https://console.hasura.io/data-plane

## Step 3. Create a project on your Data Plane

You'll create a new project using the DDN CLI and by passing two values: the `data-plane-id` (retrieved above) and the
`plan` which is a string value of either:

- `base`
- `advanced`

```sh title="Create a new project using your Data Plane ID and plan choice:"
ddn project init --data-plane-id <data-plane-id> --plan <ddn_base|ddn_advanced>
```

The CLI will return information about your newly-created project. From here, you can proceed with local development.

## Step 4. Add a data source

The command below will launch a wizard via the DDN CLI which will assist you in adding a data connector. You can learn
more about adding sources via data connectors [here](/data-sources/connect-to-a-source.mdx).

```sh title="Add a data source using the CLI:"
ddn connector init <connector_name> -i
```

This will provision the necessary files — using your configuration — for connecting a data source to your supergraph
API.

:::info Organize your data into subgraphs

You can also organize your API into **subgraphs**. Subgraphs are generally organized around team functions or business
outcomes and allow for independent ownership and governance of data sources. Learn more
[here](/project-configuration/subgraphs.mdx).

:::

## Step 5. Generate your metadata

```sh title="First, introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```sh title="Then, generate the metadata:"
ddn model add <connector_name> '*'
ddn command add <connector_name> '*'
ddn relationship add <connector_name> '*'
```

You'll see metadata files generated for each entity in your data source. You can learn more
[here](/data-modeling/overview.mdx).

## Step 6. Create a new local build

```sh title="You can now create a local build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```sh title="Then run your local services, including the Hasura DDN Engine and your connector(s):"
ddn run docker-start
```

```sh title="Finally, open the local development console usign the CLI:"
ddn console --local
```

The development console will open wherein you can run your first query.
