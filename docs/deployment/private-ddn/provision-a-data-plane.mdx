# How to Provision a Data Plane

## Introduction
A Data Plane in Hasura provides dedicated infrastructure for running your GraphQL workloads. This guide walks you through the process of provisioning a new Data Plane using Hasura's DDN VPC.

## Prerequisites
You must have dedicated data plane contracts. If you don't have any data plane contract, reach out to our sales team sales [here](https://hasura.io/contact-us). 

## Provisioning Process

### Step 1: Initiate Data Plane Provisioning

Navigate to the `Data Plane Management` section in your Hasura console ([console.hasura.io](https://console.hasura.io)).

You'll see a list of all your Data Planes that you can provision. Click the `Provision` button to start the provisioning process for the data plane.

### Step 2: Fill Out the VPC Deployment Form

Provide the following information in the form:

- **Name:** Enter a descriptive name using only letters and spaces, between 4-30 characters. This will be used to identify your Data Plane.
- **Domain:** This field is automatically generated based on your Data Plane name. Format for this is `<data-plane-name>.private-ddn-staging.hasura.app`
- **Cloud Provider:** Select your preferred cloud provider. Currently available options: `AWS`, `Google Cloud` and `Microsoft Azure`. For Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure click on `Request` and fill the request form. This will open a support ticket with Hasura. Our team will reach out to you with further instructions.
- **VPC CIDR:** A VPC /16 CIDR block assigned to your Data Plane. Default value: 10.0.0.0/16. 
- **Service CIDR:** A /16-/20 CIDR for service workloads. Default value: 172.20.0.0/16
- **Region:** Select the geographical region for your Data Plane deployment.
- **Zones:** Select exactly the same number of availability zones as mentioned in you data plane contract.

### Step 3: Submit and Monitor Provisioning

Click the `Submit` button after filling out all required fields. The provisioning process will begin, and you'll see your Data Plane listed with a Provisioning status. The provisioning process typically takes 20-25 minutes to complete.

Click on the `Provisioning` status button to see detailed progress.

## After Provisioning

Once provisioning is complete, the status will change to `Provisioned` and your Data Plane will be ready for use. To view detailed information about your Data Plane click on the Data Plane name in the Data Planes table. This will take you to a detailed view page of a data plane.
