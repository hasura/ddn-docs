# Provision a Data Plane

## Introduction

A Data Plane in Hasura provides dedicated infrastructure for running your GraphQL workloads. This guide walks you
through the process of provisioning a new Data Plane using Hasura's DDN VPC.

## Prerequisites

You must have dedicated Data Plane contracts. If you don't have any data plane contract, reach out to our sales team
sales [here](https://hasura.io/contact-us).

## Provisioning Process

### Step 1. Initiate Data Plane Provisioning

Navigate to the `Data Plane Management` section in your [Hasura console](https://console.hasura.io).

<br></br>

You'll see a list of all your Data Planes that you can provision. Click the `Provision` button to start the provisioning
process for the data plane.

### Step 2. Fill Out the VPC Deployment Form

Provide the following information in the form:

<Thumbnail src="/img/data-plane/vpc-form.png" alt="Data Plane" width="1000px" />

<br></br>

- **Name:** Enter a descriptive name using only letters and spaces, between 4-30 characters. This will be used to
  identify your Data Plane.
- **Domain:** This field is automatically generated from your Data Plane name. The format is
  `<data-plane-name>.private-ddn.hasura.app`. This is the base domain for the GraphQL API on this Data Plane.
- **Cloud Provider:** Select your preferred cloud provider. Currently available options: `AWS`. For `Google Cloud` and
  `Microsoft Azure` click on `Request` and fill the request form. This will open a support ticket with Hasura. Our team
  will reach out to you with further instructions.
- **VPC CIDR:** A /16 CIDR block that defines the IP address range for your Data Plane's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
  Default value: 10.0.0.0/16.
- **Service CIDR:** A /16-/20 CIDR block used for Kubernetes service cluster IP addresses in your Data Plane deployment.
  This CIDR range is used internally by Kubernetes to assign IP addresses to services running in the cluster. Default
  value: 172.20.0.0/16.
- **Region:** Select the geographical region for your Data Plane deployment.
- **Zones:** Select availability zones using the AZ IDs (e.g., use1-az1, use1-az2) for your Data Plane deployment. The
  number of zones selected must match your data plane contract. Choosing multiple AZs ensures higher availability and fault tolerance.

  <details>
  <summary>How to get AZ IDs</summary>

  AZ IDs are unique identifiers for Availability Zones within a region. You can obtain AZ IDs using either the AWS CLI or the AWS Console. Note that Availability Zone names (e.g., us-east-1a) may map to different physical locations for different AWS accounts, but AZ IDs remain consistent across accounts. For more information, see the [AWS documentation on working with AZ IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-az-ids.html).

  1. Using AWS CLI:
     Run the following command, replacing `<region>` with your desired region:
     ```bash
     aws ec2 describe-availability-zones \
       --region <region> \
       --output table \
       --query "AvailabilityZones[?State=='available'] | [].{ZoneName: ZoneName, ZoneId: ZoneId}"
     ```

     For example, for the us-east-1 region, the output might look like this:
     ```
     -----------------------------
     | DescribeAvailabilityZones |
     +-----------+---------------+
     |  ZoneId   |   ZoneName    |
     +-----------+---------------+
     |  use1-az1 |  us-east-1a   |
     |  use1-az2 |  us-east-1b   |
     |  use1-az3 |  us-east-1c   |
     +-----------+---------------+
     ```

  2. Using AWS Console:
     - Log in to the AWS Console
     - Navigate to the EC2 service
     - Select your desired region from the top-right corner dropdown
     - On the EC2 Dashboard page, look for the "Service health" section
     - Under "Service health", you'll find a "Zones" subsection listing the Availability Zones with their corresponding Zone IDs

  <br/>

  Remember to select the AZ IDs that correspond to your chosen region. It's best to choose at least two AZs for high availability.

:::warning Please note

VPC CIDR and Service CIDR can not be modified once the Data Plane has been provisioned.

### Step 3. Submit and Monitor Provisioning

Click the `Submit` button after filling out all required fields. The provisioning process will begin, and you'll see
your Data Plane listed with a `Provisioning` status. The provisioning process typically takes 20-25 minutes to complete.

<br></br>

Click on the `Provisioning` status button to see detailed progress.

## After Provisioning

Once provisioning is complete, the status will change to `Provisioned` and your Data Plane will be ready for use. To
view detailed information about your Data Plane click on the Data Plane name in the Data Planes table. This will take
you to a detailed view page of a data plane.
