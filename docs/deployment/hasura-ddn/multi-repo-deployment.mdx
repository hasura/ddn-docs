# Multi-Repository Deployment

For larger teams and larger projects, it can make sense to have multiple repositories contributing to the supergraph.

In this setup, one or more subgraphs are defined in each repository and depending on the role of the user, can be built
and applied to the supergraph independently.

You can read up on [collaboration](/collaboration/index.mdx) and [federation](/federation/overview.mdx) in the relevant
sections.

Deployment with a multi-repository setup is effectively the same as
[deploying from a single repository](/deployment/hasura-ddn/deploying-your-project/index.mdx), but with the
considerations of managing your context to reference the shared project, and also being aware of the differences in
abilities of the users building and deploying.

See the tables below for the roles and permissions of users on a Hasura DDN project.

Subgraph roles are only available on [DDN Advanced projects](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).

The following are the detailed permissions for the above roles:

## Deployment Flow

### Supergraph and all subgraphs

Once your context is set to the shared project, only an `Owner` or an `Admin` can build and apply the supergraph
including all subgraphs. 

Even though all subgraphs are not in the same repo, with the `ddn supergraph build create` command
