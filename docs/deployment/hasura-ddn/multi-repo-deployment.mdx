# Multi-Repository Deployment

For larger teams and larger projects, it can make sense to have multiple repositories contributing to the supergraph.

In this setup, one or more subgraphs are defined in each repository and depending on the role of the user, can be built
and applied to the supergraph independently.

Deployment with a multi-repository setup is effectively the same as deploying from a single repository, but with the
considerations of managing your context to reference the shared project and being aware of the differences in abilities
for the users.

Before you start, make sure you are familiar with the general concepts and workflows in the
[Deploying your project](/deployment/hasura-ddn/deploying-your-project/index.mdx) section.

You can also read up on [collaboration](/collaboration/index.mdx) and [federation](/federation/index.mdx) in the
relevant sections.

See the tables below for the roles and permissions of users on a Hasura DDN project.

Subgraph roles are only available on [DDN Advanced projects](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).

The following are the detailed permissions for the above roles:
