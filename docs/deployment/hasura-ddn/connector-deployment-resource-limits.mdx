# Connector Deployment Resource Limits

## Introduction

Connectors in Hasura DDN can request specific resources for their deployment. These include memory and CPU allocation for Docker-based connectors. Understanding these limits ensures optimized performance and cost efficiency.

## Default Resource Allocation

By default, connectors have the following resource allocations:

- **CPU**: 0.25 vCPU
- **Memory**: 512MB RAM

## Custom Resource Limits

### Public DDN

- **Maximum CPU**: 1 vCPU
- **Maximum RAM**: 2GB
- CPU and memory cannot be customized for Hasura-provided connectors.
- The limit and request are always set to the same value.

### Private DDN

- **Minimum CPU**: 1 vCPU
- **Minimum RAM**: 2GB
- The minimum and maximum values can be configured per customer.

## Defining Resource Limits in `connector.yaml`

Resource limits can be set at both the top level and per region for Docker-based connectors.

```yaml
title: "Example connector.yaml configuration"
kind: Connector
version: v2
definition:
  name: my_connector
  resources:
    memory: 128M # Memory in bytes (k, M, G supported)
    cpu: 0.5 # Number of CPU cores
  regionConfiguration:
    - region: us-central1
      resources:
        memory: 128M
        cpu: 2
```

### Resource Limit Overrides

When resource limits are defined at both the top level and the region level, the region-specific values take precedence over the top-level values for that particular region.

For example, if a connector is configured as follows:

```yaml
definition:
  resources:
    memory: 512M
    cpu: 1
  regionConfiguration:
    - region: us-central1
      resources:
        memory: 128M
        cpu: 2
```

- In `us-central1`, the connector will have **128MB memory and 2 vCPUs**, overriding the top-level `512MB` memory and `1 vCPU` settings.
- In any other region not explicitly defined, the top-level values (`512MB memory, 1 vCPU`) will apply.

This allows for fine-grained control over resource allocation based on deployment needs.

## Billing Considerations

Billing for resource usage is determined based on the requested resources rather than actual utilization.

- **DDN Free / Base / Advanced Plans**
- Third-party and code-based connectors are billed.
- Hasura-provided connectors are free but have fixed resource allocations.
- Future enhancements may include billing based on minimum instances.

## Deployment Considerations

- If no region is specified for a connector, it is deployed to a random region.
- The granularity for CPU allocation is **0.5 to 4 vCPUs** in increments of **0.5**.
- Hasura DDN's resource allocation model follows AWS Fargate best practices.

By optimizing resource configurations, connectors can achieve optimal performance while maintaining cost efficiency in Hasura DDN.
