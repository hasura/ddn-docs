# Hasura Private DDN

## Introduction

Hasura Private DDN allows you to provision private Data Planes — either on your own infrastructure, or dedicated Hasura
infrastructure — to give you complete control over your supergraphs. With Hasura Private DDN, enterprises can ensure
data privacy, security, and compliance by hosting the data plane within their own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provided
by Hasura or any infrastructure you choose.

:::info An enterprise contract is required for Private DDN

## Data Planes

Data Planes are at the core of Hasura Private DDN. They serve as the runtime environment for your API, handling data
access, authorization, and other operations. By deploying Data Planes privately, you can:

- **Maintain data sovereignty**: Ensure data never leaves your private infrastructure.
- **Enhance security**: Leverage existing enterprise-grade security measures, including firewalls, IAM policies, and
  more.
- **Optimize performance**: Reduce latency by hosting the data plane close to your data sources.
- **Enable BYOC**: Bring your own cloud and deploy the data plane on the cloud provider of your choice, whether it's
  AWS, GCP, Azure.

Each Data Plane integrates seamlessly with Hasura DDN's Control Plane, enabling collaborative API development, version
control, and CI/CD integration while keeping runtime operations secure and private.
