# Deployment Overview

Hasura DDN offers flexible deployment options. From fully-managed cloud hosting on Hasura DDN to self-hosted solutions.

## Deployment Options

### Hasura DDN (Managed)

The simplest way to deploy your API is using Hasura's fully-managed cloud platform. Your API runs in a globally
distributed cloud where performance, availability, and security are handled for you. Key benefits include:

- Zero infrastructure management
- Global CDN and edge caching
- Automatic scaling and high availability
- Built-in monitoring and observability
- Managed security and updates

### Private DDN

For enhanced security and control, Private DDN deployments allow you to run Hasura and your connectors either:

- On dedicated infrastructure hosted by Hasura
- On your own infrastructure (self-hosted/BYOC)

Private DDN offers:

- Enhanced security through private networking
- Direct private connectivity to your data sources
- Custom infrastructure requirements
- Compliance with specific regulatory requirements

### Self-Hosted

You can also self-host Hasura DDN:

- Deploy your own containers

Choose the deployment option and workflow that best matches your requirements for security, cost, control, and ease of
management.
