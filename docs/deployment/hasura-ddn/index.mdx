# Deployment Overview

Deploying to Hasura DDN is the optimal way to run your supergraph API. For more details on dedicated infrastructure, see
[Hasura Private DDN](/deployment/private-ddn/index.mdx). For more details on pricing plans
[our pricing page](https://hasura.io/pricing).

## Hasura DDN

With Hasura DDN your API runs in a globally distributed cloud where performance, availability, and security are handled
for you.

To deploy your API and make it accessible to the world you will create builds of your connectors, subgraphs, and the
supergraph. This can all be done in a single command. You will then apply the supergraph build to your project, making
it the "official" API for the project.

## Next steps

Use the How To guide for the most common steps to deploy your project to DDN. Try the tutorial for more detailed steps
depending on your specific connector.
