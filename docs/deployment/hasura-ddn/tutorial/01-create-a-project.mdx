# Create a Project

## What's about to happen?

We're going to create a project on Hasura DDN.

[**Projects**](/project/configuration/overview.mdxproject will contain exactly one supergraph. When you create a
project, you're creating a resource on Hasura DDN. Eventually, this can be used to serve your API.

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/quickstart.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/quickstart.mdx)

## Steps

### Step 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating the project on Hasura DDN.

```bash title="From any directory, run:"
ddn project init
```

<details>
  <summary>This command will return the project name and the console URL for your project:</summary>

```bash title="Example output:"
4:19PM INF Project "cool-cat-3685" created on Hasura DDN successfully
+-----------+---------------+
| Project   | fast-pug-7230 |
+-----------+---------------+
| Subgraphs | globals,app   |
+-----------+---------------+
```

</details>

#### What did this do?

The CLI did a lot under the hood:

- It provisioned a new project for you on Hasura DDN and then returned the project name and console URL for your
  project.
- This command also set context so this local project is mapped to the newly-created Hasura DDN project.
- It created subgraphs from your existing local project for the project on Hasura DDN.
- The CLI created a new `.env.cloud` file for variables to be used in your hosted project.

### Step 2. Update your environment variables

The following variables configure how the engine connects to a connector and authenticate that connection. These
variables are automatically updated by the CLI when creating a new connector build. They define the URLs for both
reading and writing data, as well as the authentication details needed to communicate with the connector.

| Variable                                | Description                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APP_MY_CONNECTOR_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER` | Used for setting the authorization header to authenticate requests to the connector.                                                     |
| `APP_MY_CONNECTOR_READ_URL`             | URL for reading data from the connector. Separation of read URLs allows DDN to route requests across multiple database replicas.         |
| `APP_MY_CONNECTOR_WRITE_URL`            | URL for writing data to the connector. Write URLs are routed to replicas that support write operations, configured via `connector.yaml`. |

Hasura DDN overrides the following values at runtime, so they can be left blank in the `.env.cloud` file and are
consumed by the data connector:

| Variable                                              | Description                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `APP_MY_CONNECTOR_HASURA_CONNECTOR_PORT`              | Configures the connector's HTTP server port. |
| `APP_MY_CONNECTOR_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` | Endpoint for exporting OpenTelemetry traces. |
| `APP_MY_CONNECTOR_HASURA_SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET`        | Secret for authenticating service requests.  |

If your deployed data source is available at a different address than what was used locally, you'll need to update the
connection strings in your `.env.cloud` file for each connector. This is especially important for variables like
database connection URIs.

For example, if your local environment uses a `MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_PG_CONNECTION_URI` variable, and your cloud database is
hosted elsewhere, update the `.env.cloud` file with the correct connection string:

```env title="Example of updating a connection string:"
MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_PG_CONNECTION_URI="postgresql://read_only_user:readonlyuser@35.236.11.122:5432/v3-docs-sample-app"
```

This updated value should point to the data source you intend to use with your deployed API, ensuring it can connect
properly in the cloud environment.

:::info Tunneling a connection?

If you want to test a build on Hasura DDN using a local database, you can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to
create a tunnel to your local machine. You can then update the connection URI to use this value in the `.env.cloud`
file.

:::

### Step 3. Deploy your supergraph

You're ready to deploy your supergraph! The following command will build and deploy your data connectors, update the
connectors' URLs in your `.env.cloud` file, and — finally — create a new build of your supergraph and deploy it 🎉

```bash title="Run:"
ddn supergraph build create
```

## Next steps

After you check out your newly-deployed supergraph, we recommend applying a build so it's served by your project. You
can do that from the `GraphiQL` tab of the console, or using the CLI.

```bash title="First, get the list of all builds:"
ddn supergraph build get
```

After the CLI returns the list of builds, you can apply one using its build version:

```bash title="Pass a build version to apply it:"
ddn supergraph build apply <supergraph-build-version>
```

:::tip Accelerate your first deployment
For a faster initial deployment, you can create and apply the supergraph build in a single command using
`ddn supergraph build create --apply`
