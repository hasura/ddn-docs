# Deploy a Connector

## What's about to happen?

Hasura DDN will host your deployed connectors for you, ensuring rapid delivery of data from your API to your consumers.

The process to deploy a connector is more or less the same for all connectors and varies mostly in the environment
variables required. See the [specific connector's documentation](https://hasura.io/hub) which may be on the GitHub repo
for more information.

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/quickstart.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/quickstart.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/quickstart.mdx)
- A new or existing [data connector](/quickstart.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/deployment/hasura-ddn/tutorial/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph on Hasura DDN](/deployment/hasura-ddn/tutorial/02-create-a-subgraph.mdx)

:::

### Step 1. Update the root `.env.cloud`

Usually, we will need to update the root `env.cloud` file with the connection URI we need for the cloud hosted connector
to be able to communicate with the cloud based data source.

```env title="For example, ./.env.cloud"
CONNECTION_URI=<connection-uri>
```

### Step 2. Build and deploy your cloud connector

At this stage, you can now build and deploy your connector on Hasura DDN.

You can build the entire supergraph with all subgraphs and connectors.

```bash
ddn supergraph build create
```

You can also specify exactly which subgraphs and connectors you want to build. See
[incremental builds](/deployment/hasura-ddn/incremental-builds.mdx) for more information.

To build a specific connector, run the following replacing the directory names with those that reflect your project.

```bash title="Taking care to update the path to your connector's configuration file, run:"
ddn connector build create --connector ./my_subgraph/connector/my_connector/connector.yaml
```

The CLI will respond with the URLs required to communicate with your deployed connector.

In this command we're passing the `--connector` argument, which specifies the path to the connector's configuration file
which we want to build.

## What did this do?

The steps above built and deployed your connector to Hasura DDN. So long as the connection URI you provided is reachable
by DDN, your connector will be able to communicate between your API and your data source.

## Next steps

If you have other connectors needed for a supergraph, repeat these steps for each connector. Otherwise, you're ready to
[create a new build of your supergraph](/deployment/hasura-ddn/tutorial/04-deploy-your-supergraph.mdx) and deploy it to
Hasura DDN!
