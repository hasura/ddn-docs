# Self Hosted (BYOC)

Hasura DDN is also available to self-host if you need to have complete control over
the infrastructure. The data plane is running on a Kubernetes cluster of your choice
and you control the uptime, upgrades etc. All API traffic stays within your network 
and does not leave the boundaries fo your system.

Do note that a Kubernetes cluster is required to run the data plane and it is a 
sufficiently complex system that requires advanced knowledge of Kubernetes
operations.

## Interactions with Control Plane

In Self-Hosted Hasura DDN, the data plane running on the customer's infrastructure
communicates with the control plane only in very specific scenarios. Customer data never leaves the data plane.

1. Data plane accesses a metadata storage bucket to retrieve build artifacts.
2. Data plane accesses the control plane apis to retrieve information about builds, applied builds for the purposes of routing.
3. Data plane sends observability data to control plane so that it can be visualized by the customer on the console.
4. Control plane interacts with the Kuberentes cluster to manage data plane workloads.
