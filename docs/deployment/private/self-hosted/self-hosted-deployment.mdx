# Self-Hosted (Customer Managed) Data Plane Installation Guide

:::info

Documentation here targets customers who want to self host and self manage their clusters as well as their workloads.  Here, you will find a full set of instructions, which takes you from local development all the way to having your workloads running under your Kubernetes hosted data plane.
:::

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before continuing, ensure you go through the following checklist and confirm that you meet all the requirements

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx) (Latest)
- [Docker v2.27.1](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx) (Or greater)
  - You can also run `ddn doctor` to confirm that you meet the minimum requirements
- [Helm3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) (Prefer latest)
- [Hasura VS Code Extension](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx) (Recommended, but not required)
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster
  - See Kubernetes version requirement [below](#kubernetes-version)
- Ability to build and push images that can then be pulled down from the Kubernetes cluster
- A user account on the Hasura DDN Control Plane
- A Data Plane id, key & customer identifier created by the Hasura team.  These will be referenced as `<data-plane-id>`, `<data-plane-key>` & `<customer-identifier>`

### Kubernetes version requirement {#kubernetes-version}

These instructions were tested under the following:
- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Non-Cloud Kubernetes

Version requirement: `1.28+`

## Step 1. Local development {#local-development}

:::note

In this step, you will be setting up your local development.  You will create a supergraph, add connector(s) to it and perform a local build.

For more details regarding local development, you may reference our [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started/overview/).
:::

```bash title="Login with the DDN CLI."
ddn auth login
```

```bash title="Create a local directory where your supergraph will be created.  Afterwards, cd into it."
mkdir hasura_project && cd hasura_project
```

```bash title="Initialize supergraph."
ddn supergraph init .
```

```bash title="Add a connector.  Here, we are using the -i flag for interactive mode."
ddn connector init -i
```

```bash title="Introspect the data source.  Substitute <connector-name> with name you chose for your connector above."
ddn connector introspect <connector-name>
```

```bash title="Add models, commands and relationships based on the output from previous command.  Substitute <connector-name> with name you chose for your connector above."
ddn model add <connector-name> "*"
ddn command add <connector-name> "*"
ddn relationship add <connector-name> "*"
```

```bash title="Build the supergraph locally."
ddn supergraph build local
```

```bash title="Run docker.  Ensure all containers start up successfully."
ddn run docker-start
```

```bash title="Verify via local console."
ddn console --local
```

At this point, you have connected and introspected a data source and built your supergraph locally.  Verify that everything is working as expected before moving on to the next section.

## Step 2. Build connector(s) {#build-connectors}

:::warning Building images with proper target platform

Ensure that you are building the image with the proper target platform.  If you need to build an image for a different target platform, specify it via `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=<target_platform>` prior to running the commands below.  A common `<target_platform>` to use is `linux/amd64`.
:::

:::note

Repeat the steps below for each connector within your supergraph.
:::

```bash title="Build image via docker compose.  Find the <service-name> from app/connector/<connector>/compose.yaml"
docker compose build <service-name>
```

```bash title="Re-tag the image."
docker tag <root-folder-name>-app_<connector> <your_registry>/<connector>:<your_tag>
```

```bash title="Push the image to your registry."
docker push <your_registry>/<connector>:<your_tag>
```

## Step 3. Deploy connector(s) {#deploy-connectors}

:::info Hasura DDN Helm Repo

Our DDN Helm Repo can be found [here](https://github.com/hasura/ddn-helm-charts/tree/main).  Ensure that you run through the `Get Started` section there first before you attempt to install any Helm charts.

Contact the Hasura team if you don't see a Helm chart available for your connector.
:::

Execute `helm search repo hasura-ddn` in order to find the appropriate Helm chart for your connector.  The connector chart name will be referenced as `<connector-chart-name>` within this step.

A typical connector Helm install command would look like this:

:::info

- `<connector-helm-release-name>`: Helm release name for your connector.

- `<namespace>`: Namespace to deploy connector to.

- `<container_repository_path>`: Container repository path (include the image name) which you chose in [Step #2](#build-connectors).

- `<your_tag>`: Image tag which you chose in [Step #2](#build-connectors).

- `<connector-type>`: The connector type.  Select the appropriate value from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/ddn-helm-charts/main/CONNECTORS).

- `<data-plane-id>`: Data Plane id, provided by the Hasura team.

- `<data-plane-key>`: Data Plane key, provided by the Hasura team.

- `<connector_env_variable>`: Connector Env variable name and corresponding `<value>`.  Run `helm show readme <connector-chart-name>` in order to view the connector's README, which will list out the ENV variables that you need to set in the `helm upgrade` command.
:::

:::tip

A common connector ENV variable that always needs to be passed through is `connectorEnvVars.HASURA_SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET`.  This value comes from the supergraph's `.env` file.
:::

```bash title="Connector Helm install."
helm upgrade --install <connector-helm-release-name> \
  --set namespace="<namespace>" \
  --set image.repository="<container_repository_path>" \
  --set image.tag="<your_tag>" \
  --set dataPlane.id="<data-plane-id>" \
  --set dataPlane.key="<data-plane-key>" \
  --set connectorEnvVars.<connector_env_variable>="<value>" \
  hasura-ddn/<connector-type>
```

## Step 4. Create a cloud project {#create-cloud-project}

Ensure that you are running the commands here from the root of your supergraph.

```bash title="Create cloud project."
ddn project init --data-plane-id <data-plane-id>
```

This command will create a cloud project and will report back as to what the name of your cloud project is.  We will reference this name going forward as `<ddn-project-name>`.

## Step 5. Update .env.cloud with connector URLs {#update-env-cloud}

Next, you will need to access the `.env.cloud` file which was generated at the root of your supergraph.

For **each** READ_URL & WRITE_URL, you will need to make the necessary adjustments to ensure that your v3-engine (Which will be running in your Kubernetes cluster) is properly configured to reach each one of your connectors.  The current values that these environment variables point to are for local connectivity.

The URLs of these environment variables needs to be structured as shown below.

:::info


URL: **http://`<connector-helm-release-name>`-`<connector-type>`.`<namespace>`:8080**

- `<connector-helm-release-name>`: Helm release name for your connector.

- `<connector-type>`: The connector type.  Select the appropriate value from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/ddn-helm-charts/main/CONNECTORS).

- `<namespace>`: Namespace where your connector was deployed to.
:::

## Step 6. Create a cloud build {#create-cloud-build}

After making the necessary changes to your `.env.cloud` file, run the below command.  This will create a cloud build and will also generate the necessary artifacts which will later on be consumed by your v3-engine. 

```bash title="Create a build for your cloud project."
ddn supergraph build create --self-hosted-data-plane --output-dir build-cloud --project <ddn-project-name> --out json
```

At this point, take note of the `<build_version>` and `<observability_hostname>` which will be outputted here.  You will need these later.

## Step 7. Build v3-engine {#build-engine}

:::warning Building images with proper target platform

Ensure that you are building the image with the proper target platform.  If you need to build an image for a different target platform, specify it via `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=<target_platform>` prior to running the commands below.  A common `<target_platform>` to use is `linux/amd64`.
:::

Ensure that you are running the commands from the root of your supergraph.

```bash title="Create a Dockerfile for v3-engine."
cat <<EOF >> Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/hasura/v3-engine
COPY ./build-cloud /md/
EOF
```

```bash title="Build the image via docker build.  Tag this image with your own registry and a custom tag of your choosing."
docker build -t <your_registry>/v3-engine:<your_tag> .
```

```bash title="Push the image to your registry."
docker push <your_registry>/v3-engine:<your_tag>
```

## Step 8. Deploy v3-engine {#deploy-engine}

:::note

Everytime you create a new cloud build, execute the steps below.
:::

See the DDN Helm Repo [v3-engine](https://github.com/hasura/ddn-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/v3-engine) section for full documentation.  A typical v3-engine Helm installation would look like this:

:::info

- `<v3-engine-helm-release-name>`: Helm release name for v3-engine.  A suggested name is: `v3-engine-<build_version>`.

- `<namespace>`: Namespace to deploy v3-engine to.

- `<container_repository_path>`: Container repository path (includes the image name) which you chose in [Step #7](#build-engine).

- `<your_tag>`: Image tag which you chose in [Step #7](#build-engine).

- `<observability_hostname>`: Observability hostname.  This was returned in output when `ddn supergraph build create` was executed.

- `<data-plane-id>`: Data Plane id, provided by the Hasura team.

- `<data-plane-key>`: Data Plane key, provided by the Hasura team.
:::

```bash title="v3-engine helm install."
helm upgrade --install <v3-engine-helm-release-name> \
  --set namespace="<namespace>" \
  --set image.repository="<container_repository_path>" \
  --set image.tag="<your_tag>" \
  --set observability.hostName="<observability_hostname>" \
  --set dataPlane.id="<data-plane-id>" \
  --set dataPlane.key="<data-plane-key>" \
  hasura-ddn/v3-engine
```

## Step 9. Create ingress {#create-build-ingress}

:::note

Everytime you create a new cloud build, execute the steps below.
:::

If you're using <b>nginx-ingress</b> and <b>cert-manager</b>, you can deploy using the below manifest (ie. Save it to a file and run `kubectl apply -f <file_name>`).  Ensure that you modify this accordingly

:::info


- `<build_version>`: This was part of the output when you ran `ddn supergraph build create` command.

- `<domain>`: Domain which will be used for accessing this ingress.  This could be constructed in the following format: **`<build_version>`.`<your_fqdn>`**, where `<your_fqdn>` is a hostname of your own choosing which will host your build specific APIs.

- `<namespace>`: Namespace where your v3-engine was deployed to.

- `<v3-engine-helm-release-name>`: Helm release name for your v3-engine.
:::

```bash
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
  labels:
    app: v3-engine-<build_version>
  name: v3-engine-<build_version>
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: <domain>
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: <v3-engine-helm-release-name>-v3-engine
            port:
              number: 3000
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <domain>
    secretName: <domain>-tls-certs
```

Next, you will be running the command below in order to record the ingress URL within Hasura's Control Plane.

:::info

- `<ingress-url>`: Domain name, chosen above and prepended with protocol.
:::

```bash title="Record the ingress URL for your build version."
ddn supergraph build set-self-hosted-engine-url <ingress-url> --build-version <build_version> --project <ddn-project-name>
```

## Step 10.  Deploy v3-engine (Project API specific) {#deploy-engine-project-api}

:::note Why am I deploying v3-engine again via Helm?

In this step, you will be deploying v3-engine using a unique Helm release name.  You will re-use this release name whenever you need to apply a specific build to the Project API.  This is done in order to maintain the immutable build and Project API seperation of DDN.
:::

See the DDN Helm Repo [v3-engine](https://github.com/hasura/ddn-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/v3-engine) section for full documentation.

:::info

- `<v3-engine-project-api-helm-release-name>`: Helm release name for v3-engine Project API.  This should be a unique release name which is specific to your Project API deployment.  **You will use this same name everytime you need to apply a build to the project API**.

- `<namespace>`: Namespace to deploy v3-engine to.

- `<container_repository_path>`: Container repository path which is tied to the specific build (includes the image name).

- `<your_tag>`: Image tag which is tied to the specific build.

- `<project_api_observability_hostname>`: Observability hostname for Project API.  This value is constructed as follows: `<ddn-project-name>.<customer-identifier>.observability`

- `<data-plane-id>`: Data Plane id, provided by the Hasura team.

- `<data-plane-key>`: Data Plane key, provided by the Hasura team.
:::

```bash title="v3-engine helm install."
helm upgrade --install <v3-engine-project-api-helm-release-name> \
  --set namespace="<namespace>" \
  --set image.repository="<container_repository_path>" \
  --set image.tag="<your_tag>" \
  --set observability.hostName="<project_api_observability_hostname>" \
  --set dataPlane.id="<data-plane-id>" \
  --set dataPlane.key="<data-plane-key>" \
  hasura-ddn/v3-engine
```

## Step 11.  Create ingress (Project API specific) {#create-project-ingress}

:::tip _This step needs to be executed just one time_

Below you will be creating an ingress for the Project API.
:::

**NOTE:** We are once again using an example of an ingress object which will work provided you have <b>nginx</b> and <b>cert-manager</b> installed on your cluster.  Save the contents into a file and run `kubectl apply -f <file_name>`.

:::info


- `<namespace>`: Namespace where your v3-engine was deployed to.

- `<domain>`: Domain which will be used for accessing this ingress.  This could be constructed in the following format: **`<prod-api>`.`<your_fqdn>`** or **`<ddn-project-name>`.`<your_fqdn>`** (If you want to name it after the project name).  Note that `<your_fqdn>` is a hostname of your own choosing which will host your Project API.

- `<v3-engine-project-api-helm-release-name>`: Helm release name for your v3-engine.  This matches the `<v3-engine-project-api-helm-release-name>` that was specified in [Step 10](#deploy-engine-project-api).
:::

```bash
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
  labels:
    app: v3-engine
  name: v3-engine
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: <domain>
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: <v3-engine-project-api-helm-release-name>-v3-engine
            port:
              number: 3000
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <domain>
    secretName: <domain>-tls-certs
```

After you create the ingress above, you will be running the command below in order to record the project's API URL within Hasura's Control Plane.

:::info

- `<ingress-url>`: Domain name, chosen above and prepended with protocol.
:::

```bash title="Record the ingress URL for your project's API."
ddn project set-self-hosted-engine-url <ingress-url>
```

## Step 12. Apply a build to Project API {#apply-build}

:::tip

Everytime you need to apply a specific build to your Project API, execute this step.
:::

Repeat the `helm upgrade` instructions in [Step 10](#deploy-engine-project-api), using the unique Helm release name which you chose for your Project API.  **Ensure that you are passing along the appropriate image tag for your v3-engine (ie. The image tag which is associated with the specific build that you want to apply).**

After you go through the Helm installation, you need to go ahead and mark the build as applied.  Proceed with the final step below.

:::info

- `<build_version>`: This is the build version which you just ran the `helm upgrade` for.
:::

```bash title="Mark build as applied."
ddn supergraph build apply <build_version>
```

## Step 13. View Project API via console {#view-api}

Access [Hasura console](https://console.hasura.io) and locate your cloud project.  Access your project and verify your deployment.
