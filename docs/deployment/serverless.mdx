# Serverless Edge Deployment

## Introduction

When you create a project on Hasura DDN, your GraphQL API is running on global serverless edge infrastructure hosted by
Hasura. You configure your instance to talk to your databases, APIs, or other connectors that are hosted on your
infrastructure and Hasura communicates with them over the public internet.

With serverless-edge deployment, Hasura and your connectors operate within Hasura's infrastructure. We manage automatic
scaling, provisioning, operations, and maintenance.

This deployment option is production-ready, with the API available **instantly**. There is no base cost: it is free if
you are on the Free plan, or you only pay for the [models](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) if you're on the Base or
Advanced plans. For more details, visit our [pricing page](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).

## Multi-region

Hasura DDN is deployed over many regions around the globe. This deployment model provides lowest latency possible to
your API clients. The API endpoint that Hasura DDN provides is backed by an Anycast IP address, where a single IP is
allocated for serving the incoming request and the request is routed to the nearest Hasura DDN region.

Combined with multi-region databases, Hasura DDN gives you the best performance for your APIs, without the hassle of
setting up any of this infrastructure yourself. Read more about how this works on
[our blog](https://hasura.io/blog/global-reach-local-performance-introducing-hasuras-multi-region-database-routing).
