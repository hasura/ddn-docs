# Serverless Edge Deployment

When you sign up and create a project on Hasura DDN, your
GraphQL API is running on global serverless edge infrastructure hosted
by Hasura. You configure Hasura to talk to your databases,
APIs or other connectors that are hosted on your infrastructure
and Hasura communicates with them over the public internet.

With Serverless Edge deployment, Hasura and connectors are within Hasura's 
infrastructure, and we handle automatic scaling, provisioning, operations, 
and maintenance. This is a production-ready deployment option with the API
available instantly. There is no base cost. It is either Free if you are 
on the Free plan or you pay only for the models if you're on the Base or 
Advanced plans. Read more about plans on our [pricing page](https://hasura.io/pricing/ddn).

## Multi-region

Hasura DDN is deployed over many regions around the globe. This deployment
model provides lowest latencies possible to your API clients. The API
endpoint that Hasura DDN provides is backed by an Anycast IP address,
where a single IP is allocated for serving the incoming request and 
the request is routed to the nearest Hasura DDN region.

Combined with multi-region databases, Hasura DDN gives you the best
performance for your APIs, without the hassle of setting up any of this 
infrastructure yourself. Read more about how this works on 
[our blog](https://hasura.io/blog/global-reach-local-performance-introducing-hasuras-multi-region-database-routing).
