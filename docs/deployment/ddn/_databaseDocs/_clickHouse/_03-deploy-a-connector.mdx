## What's about to happen?

Connectors are deployed independently of your supergraph and of each other. Hasura DDN will host your connectors for
you, ensuring rapid delivery of data from your API to your consumers. **For each ClickHouse connector in a project,
follow the steps below.**

## Steps

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/quickstart.mdx)
- A new or existing [supergraph](/quickstart.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph](/quickstart.mdx)
- A new or existing [data connector](/quickstart.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/deployment/ddn/01-create-a-project.mdx)
- A new or existing [subgraph on Hasura DDN](/deployment/ddn/02-create-a-subgraph.mdx)

### Step 1. Update the .env.cloud for the connector

We need to update the `env.cloud` file with any connection URI we need for the cloud hosted connector to be able to
communicate with the ClickHouse data source.

For example, you may have used a development database while iterating locally. You can now replace that value with your
staging or production database, depending on your needs.

If you've been running a local ClickHouse instance, you can replace the connection string with a cloud instance
connection string or set up an [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) tunnel to a local instance.

```env title="For example, my_subgraph/my_clickhouse/.env.cloud"
CLICKHOUSE_URL=<clickhouse-connection-uri>
CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME=<your-username>
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=<your-passowrd>
```

This key will depend on your connector.

### Step 2. Build and deploy your cloud connector

At this stage, you can now build and deploy your connector on Hasura DDN. Simply run the following replacing the
directory names with those that reflect your project.

```bash title="Taking care to update the path to your connector's configuration file, run:"
ddn connector build create --connector ./my_subgraph/connector/my_clickhouse/connector.yaml
```

The CLI will respond with read and write URLs for your deployed connector.

In this command we're passing a few arguments:

- `--connector` specifies the path to the connector's cloud configuration file which we want to build.
- `--target-env-file` specifies the path to the subgraph's cloud environment file to which the read and write URLs for
  the newly built cloud connector will be written to.
- `--target-subgraph` specifies the path to the subgraph's configuration yaml file to which the target env file belongs.
- `--target-connector-link` where the latest schema for the connector will be updated.

You're now ready to build and deploy your supergraph!

## What did this do?

The steps above built and deployed your ClickHouse connector to Hasura DDN. So long as the connection URI you provided
is reachable by DDN, your connector will be able to communicate between your API and your data source.

## Next steps

If you have other connectors needed for a supergraph, repeat these steps for each connector. Otherwise, you're ready to
[create a new build of your supergraph](/deployment/ddn/04-deploy-your-supergraph.mdx) and deploy it to Hasura
DDN!
