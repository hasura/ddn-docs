# Deploying to your own infrastructure

You are able to manage your own infrastructure for Hasura DDN.

## Simple self-hosted

Running Docker Compose on a cloud server as if it were a local development environment. This is a limited deployment
strategy where the engine and all connectors are deployed on the same server.

**_Docs coming soon_**

## Basic self-hosted

A Dockerfile with the engine and all connectors running in the same container. This setup allows users to benefit from
basic containerization.

**_Docs coming soon_**

## Advanced self-hosted

A Dockerfile for each of the engine and connectors, enabling them to be run and managed independently.

**_Docs coming soon_**

## Kubernetes self-hosted

Similar to Advanced Self-Hosted, but running the workloads on Kubernetes (K8s) for enhanced orchestration and
management.
