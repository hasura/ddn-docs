# Deploying to your own infrastructure

## Introduction

Hasura DDN is designed as a distributed system where the engine and data connectors each operate as independent
services. When deploying to your own infrastructure, you can choose to manage these services using Docker â€” either with
Docker Compose for convenience or by running individual containers for more granular control.

## Docker Compose

Running Docker Compose on a cloud server as if it were a local development environment. This is a limited deployment
strategy where the engine and all connectors are deployed on the same server.

## Standalone containers with Docker

Running individual Docker containers on a cloud server without using Docker Compose. This approach allows for more
granular control over each container, but requires manual setup of networking, environment variables, and dependencies.
