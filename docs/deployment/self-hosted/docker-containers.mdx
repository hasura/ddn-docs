# Self-Host: Standalone Docker Containers

## Introduction

This guide walks you through deploying a Hasura DDN supergraph API using individual Docker containers. This modular
approach allows you to:

- Run services on the same machine or distribute them across multiple servers.
- Scale individual components independently.
- Manually configure networking, environment variables, and orchestration.

## Prepare your project's metadata

To begin, you'll need to create a set of project metadata files using the [DDN CLI](/reference/cli/index.mdx). You can
use the [Quickstart](/quickstart.mdx) docs or get started with a
[particular connector](/how-to-build-with-ddn/overview.mdx). We recommend completing this set of steps on your host
machine or via your own CI setup.

### Step 1. Create a `.env.deployment` file

```sh title="In the root of your project, run the following to scaffold out your new env file:"
cp .env .env.deployment
```

```plaintext title="For each connector, replace the READ and WRITE URLs, for example:"
<SUBGRAPH_NAME>_<CONNECTOR_NAME>_READ_URL=http://<host>:<port>
<SUBGRAPH_NAME>_<CONNECTOR_NAME>_WRITE_URL=http://<host>:<port>
```

:::info What are these URLs?

In the strings above, `host` will refer to whatever domain or IP address your connector(s) will run on and `port` refers
to the exposed port on which the connector is listening.

You'll need to know these values before continuing.

:::

### Step 2. Create a new context

```sh title="If you haven't yet done this, create a new context using the CLI:"
ddn context create-context deployment
```

```yaml title="In .hasura/context.yaml, use the newly-created .env.deployment file:" {5}
contexts:
  deployment:
    supergraph: ../supergraph.yaml
    subgraph: ../app/subgraph.yaml
    localEnvFile: ../.env.deployment
```

### Step 3. Build your supergraph

```sh title="Using the deployment context, use the DDN CLI to create your project's metadata:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

This will generate a set of JSON configuration files in `/engine/build` using your `.env.deployment` file.

:::info Commit this to version control (optional)

As you'll be using this metadata to build your Docker images on your server(s), you'll need a method by which you can
copy these source files over. We recommend using version control (such as Git), but you can also SSH into your server
and use `scp` to transfer over your project.

## Build and run the engine

### Step 1. Build your engine's image

```bash title="On your server, with Docker installed and your latest metadata available, run the following command from the root of your project:"
docker build -t my-engine -f engine/Dockerfile.engine engine
```

This will create an image named `my-engine` using the engine's Dockerfile.

### Step 2. Run your engine

```sh title="Then, from the root of your project, start the container with the required env vars:"
docker run --rm -p 3280:3000 \
  -e AUTHN_CONFIG_PATH=/md/auth_config.json \
  -e ENABLE_CORS=true \
  -e ENABLE_SQL_INTERFACE=true \
  -e INTROSPECTION_METADATA_FILE=/md/metadata.json \
  -e METADATA_PATH=/md/open_dd.json \
  -e OTLP_ENDPOINT=<your_otlp_collector_endpoint> \
  --add-host=local.hasura.dev:host-gateway \
  my-engine
```

```sh title="You can verify this by sending a schema introspection request to your API:"
curl -X POST https://<your-domain-or-ip>:3280/graphql \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "{ __schema { types { name } } }"}'
```

Of course, without a connector built and running, you won't be able to query data from the API.

## Build and run a connector

This process will need to be repeated for **each** connector.

### Step 1. Build your connector's image

```bash title="On your server, with Docker installed and the latest metadata available, run the following command from the root of your project:"
docker build -t my-connector -f <subgraph_name>/connector/<connector_name>/.hasura-connector/Dockerfile.<connector_name> <subgraph_name>/connector/<connector_name>/
```

This will create an image named `my-connector` using the connector's Dockerfile.

### Step 2. Run your connector

```sh title="Then, from the root of your project, start the container with the required env vars:"
docker run --rm -p 9758:8080 \
  -e CONNECTION_URI="<your_database_connection_uri>" \
  -e HASURA_SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET="<your_service_token_secret>" \
  -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="<your_otlp_collector_endpoint>" \
  -e OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="<subgraph_name>_<my_connector>" \
  --add-host=local.hasura.dev:host-gateway \
  my-connector
```

:::info Where do I find these values?

You can find these values in the `.env.deployment` file you created earlier.
