# Create a Subgraph

## What's about to happen?

You're about to create a subgraph on Hasura DDN.

Subgraphs can be rebuilt at any point to reflect changes made in connectors or other metadata related to models,
commands, relationships, or permissions.

:::tip Required

- [DDN CLI](/getting-started/quickstart.mdx)
- A new or existing [project](/deployment/deployment/01-create-a-project.mdx)

:::

For each subgraph you're deploying, run the following to create it on Hasura DDN, replacing `my_subgraph` with your
desired name. The name should match the subgraph name from your `supergraph.yaml` file in your local metadata.

## Steps

### Step 1. Create a subgraph

```bash title="From any project directory, run:"
ddn project subgraph create my_subgraph
```

## What did this do?

Seemingly, this was an unimpressive step. However, subgraphs in your local metadata will map to resources on Hasura DDN.
Thus, for each subgraph you have in local metadata, you'll create the companion on Hasura DDN.

## Next steps

With a subgraph provisioned on Hasura DDN, you can now begin
[building and deploying your connectors](/deployment/deployment/deploy-a-connector) that service this subgraph.
