      <p>
        Hasura DDN is a fully managed SaaS product where your API is running on the cloud, where performance,
        availability and security is already taken care of for you. Your API will be running on Hasura's optimized
        serverless production infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        For organizations with advanced security and compliance needs, Hasura DDN can be deployed within isolated
        compute and network infrastructure hosted with a cloud provider and thier regions that you choose. Private
        deployment of Hasura DDN enables secure connectivity to your data sources, whether they are within your Cloud
        VPCs or on-prem infrastructure. You can also configure the API to be exposed over internal IP alone. Advanced
        firewalll rules and API protections are available
      </p>
      <p>
        Hasura DDN can also be self-hosted within your own infrastructure, provided a Kubernetes cluster is available.
        You can also connect your own Cloud provider account with Hasura Cloud and have Hasura DDN deployed within that
        account.
