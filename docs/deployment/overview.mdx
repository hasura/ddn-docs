      <p>
        Hasura DDN is a fully managed SaaS product where your API is running on the cloud,
        where performance, availability and security is already taken care of for you.
        Your API will be running on Hasura's optimized serverless production infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        For organizations with advanced security and compliance needs, Hasura DDN can be
        deployed within isolated compute and network infrastructure hosted with a cloud 
        provider and thier regions that you choose. Private deployment of Hasura DDN
        enables secure connectivity to your data sources, whether they are within your 
        Cloud VPCs or on-prem infrastructure. You can also configure the API to be exposed
        over internal IP alone. Advanced firewalll rules and API protections are available
      </p>
      <p>
        DDN can also be self-hosted within your own infrastructure, provided a Kubernetes
        cluster is available. You can also connect your own Cloud provider account with Hasura
        Cloud and have DDN deployed within that account.
