# Deployment

## Introduction

There are a few ways to deploy your supergraph API.

## Hasura DDN

You can host your API on fully-managed Hasura DDN.

- Zero infrastructure management
- Global CDN and edge caching
- Automatic scaling and high availability
- Built-in monitoring and observability
- Managed security and updates

## Private DDN

Hasura Private DDN is an enterprise-grade deployment offering to run your API on dedicated infrastructure.

You can also host your [Data Plane](/help/glossary#data-plane) on your own infrastructure, and the
[Control Plane](/help/glossary#control-plane) on Hasura DDN.

- Enhanced security through private networking
- Direct private connectivity to your data sources
- Custom infrastructure requirements
- Compliance with specific regulatory requirements

## Self-Hosted

You can also self-host the v3 engine and connectors on your own Docker-based infrastructure.

- Includes a basic version of the console with GraphiQL and metadata explorer.
- Includes all API related features, plugins and connectors.
- Does not include a control plane: no built-in CI/CD (or build versioning), schema registry, API analytics.
- Observability is not built-in but you can export traces to your own 3rd party service.
