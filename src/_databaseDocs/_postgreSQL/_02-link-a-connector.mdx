## Step 1. Create the Hasura metadata

Hasura DDN uses a concept called a [`DataConnectorLink`](/supergraph-modeling/data-connectors.mdx) to take
[NDC-compliant](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec) `configuration.json` and transform it into an `hml` (Hasura Metadata
Language) file.

You can create this file, which will be scaffolded out as `mypg.hml` in a new `metadata` subdirectory for your subgraph
by running:

```bash
ddn connector-link add mypg
```

The generated file has two environment variables â€” one for reads and one for writes â€”Â that you'll need to add to your
subgraph's `.env` file. As with the example we've followed so far, if we have a subgraph of `ux`, we'll need to add the
following snippet to our `ux/.env.ux` file:

```env
UX_MYPG_READ_URL=http://local-dev.hasura.me:8081
UX_MYPG_WRITE_URL=http://local-dev.hasura.me:8081
```

These values are for the PostgreSQL connector itself and utilize `local-dev.hasura.me` to ensure proper resolution
within the docker container.

## Step 2. Update the DataConnectorLink

Finally,jnow that our DataConnectorLink has the correct environment variables configured for the PostgreSQL connector,
we can update it to reflect our database's schema in `hml`:

```bash
ddn connector-link update mypg
```

After this command runs, you can open your `<subgraph>/connector/mypg/metadata/mypg/mypg.hml` file and see your metadata
completely scaffolded out for you ðŸŽ‰
