import BaseUrlLink from '@site/src/_databaseDocs/baseLink';

### Step 1. Install node packages

The TypeScript connector is a regular TypeScript project. We can use any node packages we want.

:::tip Required

- <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/prerequisites" text="The DDN CLI, VS Code extension, and Docker installed" />
- A new or existing <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/init-supergraph" text="supergraph" />
- A new or existing <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/init-subgraph" text="subgraph" />
- A <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/connect-to-data/connect-a-source" text="PostgreSQL connector"/> initialized
- A <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/connect-to-data/create-source-metadata" text="DataConnectorLink"/> configured

:::

We'll use the `dotenv` and `pg` packages to access our connection string, saved as an environment variable, and to
connect to our database.

```bash title="From the my_subgraph/connector/my_ts directory, run:"
npm i dotenv pg
```

### Step 2. Add the connection URI

We'll add our PostgreSQL connection string as an environment variable to our connector's `.env.local` file. This will
allow us to access the connection string in our function.

```env title="my_subgraph/connectors/my_ts/.env.local"
CONNECTION_URI=<your-postgres-connection-string>
```

### Step 3. Create a function

The TypeScript connector uses [JSDoc comments](https://jsdoc.app/) to determine how to expose a function: either as a
query or a mutation. If we include the `@readOnly` tag, it will be exposed as a query. Simply omitting this tag will
expose the function as a mutation.

We can even add documentation that will be visible in the GraphiQL explorer by tagging `@param` for the argument(s) and
`@returns` for what will be returned by the mutation.

```ts title="my_subgraph/connectors/my_ts/functions.ts"
import { Client } from 'pg';
import { config } from 'dotenv';

// Load environment variables from .env.local
dotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' });

/**
 * @param userData An object containing the user's data.
 * @returns The ID of the newly inserted user.
 */
export async function insertUser(userData: { name: string; email: string }): Promise<string> {
  const client = new Client({
    connectionString: process.env.CONNECTION_URI,
  });

  await client.connect();

  const queryText = `
    INSERT INTO users (name, email)
    VALUES ($1, $2)
    RETURNING id
  `;
  const values = [userData.name, userData.email];
  const result = await client.query(queryText, values);

  await client.end();

  if (result.rows.length > 0) {
    return result.rows[0].id;
  } else {
    throw new Error('Failed to insert user');
  }
}
```

### Step 3. Track the function

Just as before, we'll track our function using the CLI by first updating our `DataConnectorLink`.

```bash title="From any directory in the project, run:"
ddn connector-link update myts
```

And then bringing in the new command.

```bash title="From any directory in the project, run:"
ddn command add --connector-link myts --name insertUser
```

### Step 4. Create a new build and test

Next, let's create a new build of our supergraph.

```bash title="From the root of the project, run:"
ddn supergraph build local --output-dir ./engine
```

:::tip Start your engines!

Want to test your supergraph? Don't forget to start your GraphQL engine and connectors using the following command.

```bash title="From the root of your project, run:"
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn auth print-pat) docker compose -f docker-compose.hasura.yaml watch
```

**If you haven't [included your connector(s)](/getting-started/01-init-supergraph.mdx) in your
`docker-compose.hasura.yaml`, don't forget to start it as well.**

:::

Finally, should see your command available, along with its documentation, in the GraphiQL explorer as a mutation.

## What did this do?

This function created a mutation that we can use to insert data directly into our database. We utilized raw SQL to
leverage the native features of PostgreSQL directly from our TypeScript function. While the example above is used to
insert data, you can use the same principles to modify or delete existing data in your database via your GraphQL API.
