## What's about to happen?

We want to connect our MongoDB database to our API. To do this, we use the Hasura MongoDB data connector to facilitate
the connection and then introspect the database to generate JSON which the Hasura CLI will then use to create metadata
which can then define your API.

## Step 1. Initialize the MongoDB connector

:::tip Required

- <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/prerequisites" text="DDN CLI" />
- A new or existing <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/init-supergraph" text="supergraph" />
- A new or existing <BaseUrlLink to="/getting-started/init-subgraph" text="subgraph" />

:::

To initialize the MongoDB connector, run the following, replacing `<subgraph-name>` with the name of the subgraph which
will contain this data connector:

```bash
ddn connector init my_mongo --dir <subgraph-name>/connector/my_mongo --hub-connector hasura/mongodb
```

In this command, we're passing a few important values.

**Connector name**

We're naming the connector `my_mongo` in this example, but you can call it whatever makes sense to you. For example, if
this connector is integrating a database all about product metadata, it would make sense to name it something like
`product_metadata_mongodb_connector`.

**Directory for the connector**

We want to keep our project organized with each data connector's configuration located in a relevant subgraph directory.
To do this we're passing the required `--dir` flag to tell the CLI that the configuration files it's generating should
be saved in the subgraph directory. In this example the CLI will create a `connector/my_mongo` directory if it doesn't
exist.

:::note Best practice

Importantly, a data connector can only connect to one data source.

The name of the connector and the directory in which the configuration is stored, `my_mongo` in this example, should
match for convenience and clarity sake.

:::

**Connector type**

We're specifying that this connector should be the: `hasura/mongodb`, connector listed in the
[Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors/mongodb).

### What did this do?

In the `<subgraph-name>/connector/my_mongo` directory which we specified in the command, the CLI created:

- A `connector.yaml` file which contains the configuration for the connector.
- A `connector-metadata.yaml` file which contains extra metadata for the connector.
- A `docker-compose.my_mongo.yaml` a file to run the MongoDB data connector locally in Docker.
- A placeholder `.buildignore` file to prevent unnecessary files from being included in the build.
- An `.env.local` placeholder file for environment variables for pertaining to running this connector locally.

Right now, the CLI has only scaffolded out configuration files for the data connector. Our connector still knows nothing
about the MongoDB database or the data it contains. That's coming up in the next steps.

## Step 3. Include the MongoDB connector's Docker compose file

In our main `docker-compose.yaml` in the **_root of the project_**, add the following at the top taking care to replace
`<subgraph-name>` with your subgraph:

```yaml
include:
  - path: <subgraph-name>/connector/my_mongo/docker-compose.my_mongo.yaml
```

### What did this do?

We want to be able to start our MongoDB connector when we start our main top-level Hasura engine services in Docker. By
including the connector's compose file in the main `docker-compose.yaml`, we're telling Docker Compose to start the
MongoDB connector alongside those main services.

## Step 4. Add the MongoDB connection URI

Now that our MongoDB data connector has been scaffolded out for us, we need to provide a **connection string** so that
we can connect to it. To do this we'll first need a MongoDB database to connect to.

The CLI has provided an `.env` file for our connector. We can add a key-value pair of `MONGODB_DATABASE_URI` along with
the connection string itself to this file and our connector will use this to connect to our MongoDB database. The file,
after adding the `MONGODB_DATABASE_URI` should look like this example:

```env
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://local.hasura.dev:4317
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my_pg
MONGODB_DATABASE_URI="mongodb+srv://john:N2Mvjfd3DldRjVrP@mydemo.shh5x2t.mongodb.net/sample_demo?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=MyDemo"
```

Remember to use quotes as the string will likely have some characters which will break the `.env` file if not enclosed.

This value is already referenced in the scaffolded out
`<subgraph-name>/connector/my_mongo/hasura-connector/connector-metadata.yaml` file. Eg:

```yaml
---
supportedEnvironmentVariables:
  - name: MONGODB_DATABASE_URI
description: The URI for the MongoDB database
```

You can use a local MongoDB database, or a cloud-hosted one like MongoDB Atlas. Check out
[this page](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) for a list of options for running a MongoDB database if
you don't already have one. If you already have one you can connect to, you can go ahead and do that. Hasura DDN will
not modify your database in any way, so you can use an existing database without any worries.

:::info Environment-specific caveats

**Local Mongo**

If you're using a local MongoDB database — such as through [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongodb) — you can connect
to it directly from the data connector. However, if you deploy your supergraph to Hasura DDN the cloud-hosted version of
your data connector won't be able to find your database. So tunneling that connection from the start with a tool like
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a good idea.

**Cloud-hosted MongoDB**

Alternatively, if you have a cloud-hosted database, perhaps with
[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database) as Hasura DDN will need to reach your
database, ensure you've allowlisted `0.0.0.0/0` so that DDN is able to reach it. To learn how to deploy a MongoDB Atlas
cluster, see the [official documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/).

:::

## Step 5. Start the services

Let's start all of our Docker services, which includes the GraphQL engine, an authentication webhook provider, Jaeger
for observability, and our connector. Run the following from the root of the project:

```bash
HASURA_DDN_PAT=$(ddn internal print-pat) docker compose -f docker-compose.hasura.yaml watch
```

You should see your various services returned as `Running` or `Started` in the terminal. This provides a watch mode,
which will allow us to iteratively modify and test our API locally with blazing-fast feedback loops.

## Step 6. Introspect your database

With the connector configured, we can now use the CLI to introspect our MongoDB database to create a source-specific
configuration file for our connector:

```bash
ddn connector introspect --connector <subgraph-name>/connector/my_mongo/connector.yaml
```

### What did this do?

We specify the connector (and by proxy, the data source) that we want to introspect with the `--connector` flag and
provide it with the location of that `connector.yaml` configuration file.

The CLI will introspect the MongoDB database and generate a few new files in the `connector/my_mongo/` directory.

These include a `configuration.json` file and a new `schema` directory with a definition of all collections found in
MongoDB in a JSON [NDC-compliant](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec) Hasura metadata format.

Eg:

```text
.
├── comments.json
├── embedded_movies.json
├── movies.json
├── sessions.json
├── theaters.json
└── users.json
```

:::tip o11y via OpenTelemetry

Yes! Connectors ship with OTEL-enabled tracing available, out of the box 🎉

## Next steps

With this JSON configuration, which represents the collections in MongoDB, we can now use it to generate Hasura
metadata.
