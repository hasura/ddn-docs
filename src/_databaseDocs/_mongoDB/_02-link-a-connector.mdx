Now that you've:
- [Created your Supergraph](/getting-started/01-init-supergraph.mdx)
- [Added a Subgraph](/getting-started/02-init-subgraph.mdx)
- [Connected to your MongoDB database via the MongoDB data connector](/getting-started/03-expose-source-entities.mdx)

You're now ready to transform your data connector configuration files into valid Hasura metadata.

If you haven't done any of the previous steps please go back and complete them.

## Step 1. Add the DataConnectorLink object

Hasura DDN uses a concept called "connector linking" to take [NDC-compliant](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec)
configuration JSON files for a data connector and transform them into an `hml` (Hasura Metadata Language) file as a
<BaseUrlLink to="/supergraph-modeling/data-connectors/" text="DataConnectorLink" /> metadata object.

First we need to create this `hml` file with the `connector-link add` command and then convert our configuration files
into `hml` syntax and add it to this file with the `connector-link update` command.

Let's name the `hml` file the same as our connector, `my_mongo`:

```bash
ddn connector-link add my_mongo
```

The new file is scaffolded out at `<subgraph-name>/metadata/my_mongo/my_mongo.hml`.

```yaml
kind: DataConnectorLink
version: v1
definition:
  name: my_mongo
  url:
    readWriteUrls:
      read:
        valueFromEnv: MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_MONGO_READ_URL
      write:
        valueFromEnv: MY_SUBGRAPH_MY_MONGO_WRITE_URL
  schema:
    version: v0.1
    schema:
      scalar_types: {}
      object_types: {}
      collections: []
      functions: []
      procedures: []
    capabilities:
      version: ""
      capabilities:
        query: {}
        mutation: {}
```

This file is pretty empty, but you can see it specifies the environment variables for the read and write URLs for the
MongoDB connector. Because we've already started up these services in Docker, we'll add these values to our
subgraph's `.env` file.

```env
SUBGRAPH_NAME_MYMONGO_READ_URL=http://local-dev.hasura.me:8080
SUBGRAPH_NAME_MYMONGO_WRITE_URL=http://local-dev.hasura.me:8080
```

## Step 2. Update the new DataConnectorLink object with metadata for your MongoDB database

Finally, now that our `DataConnectorLink` has the correct environment variables configured for the MongoDB connector,
we can run the update command to have the CLI look at the configuration JSON for our connector and transform it to
reflect our database's schema in `hml` format:

```bash
ddn connector-link update my_mongo
```

After this command runs, you can open the same `<subgraph-name>/metadata/my_mongo/my_mongo.hml` file and see
your metadata completely scaffolded out for you ðŸŽ‰

### What did this do?

`hml` files are...
