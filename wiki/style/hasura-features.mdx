# Hasura Feature Names

- Hasura feature names should all use Title Case.
- Concepts and common industry terms, such as "data federation", "authentication, "mutations", "connection pools",
  "builds", and "metadata" are not features and don't need to be capitalized.
- If the name is written without the "Hasura" prefix it still needs to have a cap.
- An extensive, but continually evolving, list of feature names is below:
  - Hasura CLI
  - Hasura Cloud
  - Hasura Console
  - Hasura Enterprise
  - Hasura GraphQL API Explorer
  - Hasura GraphQL Engine
  - Hasura Community Edition
  - Hasura OSS
- Always capitalize and use the full name for 3rd party products appropriately. E.g., PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server,
  BigQuery.
- When referring to the Open Domain Data Specification, use the full name on first reference, and then use "Open DD
  Spec" on subsequent references.
- When referring to the Data Delivery Network, use the full name on first reference, and then use "DDN" on subsequent
  references.
