# Hasura DDN Docs

Welcome to the Hasura DDN Docs repository! This is the official documentation for Hasura DDN. Below, you'll find
instructions on how to install, run, and contribute to the project.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, simply run:

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Local Development

To start a local development server and preview the docs:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

This command will open a browser window, and any changes you make will automatically reflect without needing to restart
the server. Perfect for quick iterations!

## Build

To build the documentation for production:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

This generates static content into the `build` directory, which can be hosted using any static hosting service.

## Contributing

[Contribution Guide](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/wiki/contributing/) for all the details on how to get involved ðŸ¤™.

We appreciate all contributions to make our docs better for everyone! ðŸ™Œ
