# OpenAPI Connector

## Introduction

Using the Hasura [OpenAPI Lambda Connector](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-open-api-lambda), you can instantly import
OpenAPI-compliant APIs into your GraphQL API. Any `GET` requests are tagged as `@readonly` using the Node.js Lambda
connector and are exposed as queries in your GraphQL API. All others are then exposed as procedures, allowing you to
mutate data.

## Features

- Convert Open API/swagger documentation into Typescript functions compatible with NodeJS Lambda Connector
- Supported request types

| Request Type | Query | Path | Body | Headers |
| ------------ | ----- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| GET          | ✅    | ✅   | NA   | ✅      |
| POST         | ✅    | ✅   | ✅   | ✅      |
| DELETE       | ✅    | ✅   | ✅   | ✅      |
| PUT          | ✅    | ✅   | ✅   | ✅      |
| PATCH        | ✅    | ✅   | ✅   | ✅      |

## Getting started

To get started with the OpenAPI Lambda Connector, you can follow the [guide here](/quickstart.mdx).

:::info Prerequisites

If you've never used Hasura DDN, we recommend that you first go through the
[getting started](/how-to-build-with-ddn/overview.mdx). 😊

Additionally, if you haven't read through the [TypeScript connector docs](/business-logic/typescript.mdx), check them
out first.
