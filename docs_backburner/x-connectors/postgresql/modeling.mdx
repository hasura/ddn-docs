# Data Modeling

The PostgreSQL data connector makes available any database resource that is listed in its configuration. In order to
populate the configuration, the connector supports introspecting the database via the CLI `update` command, see
[updating with introspection](/connectors/postgresql/configuration-reference/index.mdx#updating-with-introspection).

## Queryable collections

The PostgreSQL data connector supports several types of queryable collections:

- Tables
- Views
- Native Operations

Tables and views are typically discovered automatically during the introspection process.

Native queries on the other hand are named SQL select statements that you specify in the data connector configuration.
They are similar to a database view, but more expressive as they admit parameters similar to a function and do not
require any DDL permissions on the database. See the configuration reference on
[Native Queries](/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/).

## Scalar types

The PostgreSQL data connector supports any scalar type that PostgreSQL knows how encode and decode as JSON - No scalar
type is handled as a special case.

:::tip Data type names

Many scalar types have aliases in PostgreSQL, which can be found in the [PostgreSQL documentation on data
types][PostgreSQL: data types]. The connector exposes only the canonical name of a scalar type (as per
[`pg_catalog.pg_type(typname)`][PostgreSQL: pg_type]) in its NDC schema.

In order to use standard GraphQL scalar types rather than custom scalar types in the resulting GraphQL schema, the DDN
configuration enables expressing a mapping between data connector types and GraphQL types.

:::

:::info Limited support

The data connector doesn't currently support [range][PostgreSQL: CREATE TYPE] types, and the introspection process will
not include entities of these types.

Manually adding entries for a type to the configuration may work to an extent, but there is no guarantee that it will
work as expected.

:::

## Structural types

The data connector supports PostgreSQL array and composite types, and they will appear as such in the schema it exposes.

Collections may have columns that are arrays of any supported type, and columns that are of a composite type, and
arbitrary combinations thereof.

As an example (irrespective of whether this is a good database design or not) the following may be tracked with full
typing fidelity:

```sql
CREATE TYPE address AS (address_lines varchar[], zipcode varchar, country varchar);
CREATE TABLE person(id int primary key, name varchar, address address);
```

Note that the `json` and `jsonb` types are not considered structural types. They are opaque scalar types that do not
admit to any schema.

## Queries

The connector supports all query operations; see the [query documentation](/graphql-api/queries/index.mdx) for details.

### Filtering

The connector supports the introspection and usage of all binary comparison functions and operators defined for any
tracked scalar type, built-in and user-defined alike.

However, because PostgreSQL operators don't translate syntactically well to GraphQL, and because not all binary
procedures are necessarily appropriate comparison operators, the introspection process needs some guidance in order to
map names and select which functions to include. See the configuration reference for
[Comparison Operators](/connectors/postgresql/configuration-reference/version-5#scalartypes) for details.

## Mutations

We currently support two types of mutations:

### Point mutations

These are single row insert, delete and update mutations generated for each database table, and exposed as procedures
which can used as `Commands` in OpenDD. To expose these, set `mutationsVersion: "v2"` in your
[configuration](/connectors/postgresql/configuration-reference/version-5#mutationsversion-v2).

- An insert procedure is generated per table

  ```graphql
  v2_insert_<table>(
      objects: [<table-object>],
      post_check: <boolexpr>
  )
  ```

  Using it, you can insert multiple objects and include a post check for permissions.

- A delete procedure is generated for each unique constraint on each table

  ```graphql
  v2_delete_<table>_by_<column_and_...>(
      key_<column1>: <value>,
      key_<column2>: <value>,
      ...,
      pre_check: <boolexpr>
  )
  ```

  Using it, you can delete a single row using the uniqueness constraint, and include a pre-check for permissions.

- An update procedure is generated for each unique constraint on each table

  ```graphql
  v2_update_<table>_by_<column_and_...>(
      key_<column1>: <value>,
      key_<column2>: <value>,
      ...,
      update_columns: { <column>: { _set: <value> }, ... },
      pre_check: <boolexpr>,
      post_check: <boolexpr>
  )
  ```

  Using it, you can update a single row using the uniqueness constraint by updating the relevant columns, and include a
  pre-check and post-check for permissions.

The `pre_check` and `post_check` arguments of a mutation, can be set in metadata for all queries using an
[Argument Preset](/supergraph-modeling/permissions#commandpermissions-argumentpreset) on the mutation's
[Command Permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions#commandpermissions-commandpermission).

### Native Mutations

You can also write your own SQL queries and expose them via the GraphQL engine using
[Native Mutations](/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/custom-mutations.mdx).
