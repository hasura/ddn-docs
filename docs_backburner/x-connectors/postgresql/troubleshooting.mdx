# Troubleshooting

Check the questions below for common hiccups when using the `hasura/postgres` native data connector.

:::info My question isn't answered here

Reach out to us [for help](/support/get-support.mdx), we're here for you!

:::

## I received the error message `error communicating with database`

This error message indicates that there was a problem connecting to the database. Some common issues are a typo in the
connection string, a firewall blocking access, etc.

If you receive such an error, make sure that the PostgreSQL database is live, and that you can connect to it from your
machine using `psql` using the same connection string supplied to your `ndc-postgres` connector.

## I received the error message `invalid port number`

If there isn't a problem with the port number itself, this might indicate a problem with the connection string URI in
general. One issue in particular might rise from a password containing certain characters, such as '#'. In order to
passwords containing these characters, they need to be escaped. This can be done using the `encodeURIComponent` function
in Node.js:

```sh
$ node
Welcome to Node.js v20.10.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
> encodeURIComponent('^password#');
'%5Epassword%23'
```

## I've changed my database schema and would like these changes propagated in Hasura

Running the [ddn connector introspect](/cli/commands/ddn_connector_introspect.mdx) command tells the CLI to update the
`ndc-postgres` configuration. Note that the `metadata.tables` part of the configuration will be refreshed and
overwritten when a change occurs.

## I'd like to tweak how the connector works or does database introspection

The connector settings can be modified by editing the connector configuration. For example, you can tweak the
[Pool Settings](/connectors/postgresql/configuration-reference/version-5#poolsettings), change the
[Isolation Level](/connectors/postgresql/configuration-reference/version-5#isolationlevel) of transactions, or choose
[which schema not to introspect](/connectors/postgresql/configuration-reference/version-5#excludedschemas).

See the [Configuration Reference](/connectors/postgresql/configuration-reference) for more information.

## I'm having issues getting my Native Query to run

There are certain requirements that the SQL of a Native Query must fulfill, such omitting the semicolon in the SQL, or
using arguments only in place of scalar values.

More information can be found in the
[Native Queries SQL Requirements](/connectors/postgresql/native-operations/index.mdx) section.
