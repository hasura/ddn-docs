# Data Modeling

The ClickHouse data connector makes available any database resource that is listed in its configuration. In order to
populate the configuration, the connector supports introspecting the database via the CLI `update` command. See more
[here](/cli/commands/ddn_connector-link_update.mdx).

## Queryable collections

The ClickHouse data connector supports several types of queryable collections:

- Tables
- Views
- Native Queries

Tables and views are typically discovered automatically during the introspection process.

Native queries on the other hand are named SQL select statements that you specify in the data connector configuration.
They are similar to a database view, but more expressive as they admit parameters similar to a function and do not
require any DDL permissions on the database. See the configuration reference on
[Native Queries](/connectors/clickhouse/native-queries/).

## Data Types

The ClickHouse data connector supports most ClickHouse data types with the notable exception of the Variant type.

## Queries

The connector supports all query operations; see the [query documentation](/graphql-api/queries/index.mdx) for details.

## Mutations

Mutations are currently not supported.
