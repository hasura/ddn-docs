# Introduction

## What is a data connector?

A data connector is an HTTP service that exposes a set of APIs that Hasura uses to communicate with the data source. The
data connector is responsible for interpreting work to be done on behalf of the Hasura Engine, using the native query
language of the data source.

Data connectors, which are built to conform to the [NDC Specification](http://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/) using one of
our available SDKs, enable anyone to connect rich, highly-native data sources to their supergraph.

The NDC Specification defines a set of APIs that a data connector must implement. These APIs, which accept and return
JSON, are used by Hasura to communicate with the data connector. The NDC specification also defines a set of metadata
that the data connector must provide to Hasura. This metadata is used by Hasura to introspect the data connector,
generate the GraphQL schema, and execute operations against the data source.

You can [build your own data connector](/connectors/build-your-own/index.mdx), or use one of the many connectors
available on the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors).

There are two main types of connectors available for use in Hasura DDN projects: verified and non-verified connectors.

### Verified connectors

Verified connectors are listed on the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors). These are deployable to Hasura DDN
using the Hasura CLI.

### Non-verified connectors

Non-verified connectors have not been verified by Hasura. These are only deployable on your own infrastructure.
