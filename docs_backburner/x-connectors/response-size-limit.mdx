# Connector Response Size Limit

The maximum size for responses from connectors is **30 MB**. Beyond this threshold, Hasura will reject the response to
ensure optimum performance and data processing. It's important to be mindful of this constraint when making data queries
to Hasura's [GraphQL API](/graphql-api/overview/).

To prevent hitting the response size limit, API consumers are encouraged to utilize the
[limit argument](/graphql-api/queries/pagination#limit-results) in their queries to avoid over-fetching data from
sources via data connectors.

When GraphQL API requests exceed this size limit, they will result in an
[internal error](/graphql-api/errors#internal-errors) API response.

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "internal error"
    }
  ]
}
```

Hasura users are advised to check the traces for more detailed error information, which includes the actual response
size from the connector.

:::note Response size limit increases

If you require an increase in the response size limit, please reach out to [Hasura support](https://hasura.io/help/) for
