The section covers the implementation of basic aggregate functions (`star_count` and `column_count`) in an SQLite
connector for Hasura.

It involves modifying the `fetch_aggregates` function to handle these aggregates, constructing a SQL query that applies
the correct count functions, and ensuring that the query respects any specified conditions like predicates, sorting, or
pagination.

The `star_count` aggregate counts all entries, while `column_count` counts non-null values in a specific column, with
the option to count distinct values. The section concludes with testing the connector to ensure correct SQL generation
and functionality.
