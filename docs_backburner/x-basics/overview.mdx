# Understanding Hasura DDN

Hasura DDN is all about seamlessly connecting your data sources to the Hasura Engine using a flexible metadata standard
and a concept called native data connectors. This architecture, known as a **data supergraph**, enables a 100%
code-first approach with instant API generation.

With Hasura DDN, you can easily connect and combine data from all your sources, breaking down data silos. You'll have
clear visibility into your queries, strong security controls, and a reliable, resilient system. Enjoy the flexibility to
scale as needed, streamline your development workflow with powerful CI/CD tools, and optimize performance with native
queries, all while keeping your data secure and your business logic central.
