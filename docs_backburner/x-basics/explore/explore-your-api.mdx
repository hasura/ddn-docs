# Explore your Supergraph

## Overview

Exploring an API's structure and relationships is often problematic, posing significant challenges to developers and
teams. The reliance on limited external tools can result in incomplete or inaccurate representations of the API, making
it difficult to fully understand its complexities.

Manual documentation further complicates the process, as it is time-consuming to create and update, and is prone to
errors. Additionally, coordinating across teams without a shared understanding of the API can lead to miscommunication
and delays, hampering efficient development. These issues underscore the need for more robust and integrated solutions.

The console's — Hasura's web-based GUI — explorer page offers:

- **Comprehensive Visualization:** See a complete, real-time visual representation of your API, including relationships
  and permissions.
- **Auto-Generated Documentation:** Automatically generate and update API documentation, ensuring consistency and
  accuracy.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Foster better communication and coordination across teams with a shared, intuitive visual
  tool.

You can also use the console to [interact with](/basics/explore/interact.mdx) and [monitor](/basics/explore/monitor.mdx)
your API.

## Step 1. Explore your supergraph

Click on the `Explorer` button in the sidenav to quickly and easily see a visualization of your entire
[supergraph](/basics/core-concepts#supergraph):

  alt="Visualization of the entire supergraph"

/>

This provides a high-level overview of your entire supergraph. You can see the various subgraphs, their data sources,
and any relationships present within or between subgraphs. You can also adjust the view options to project different
layouts, helping you represent your data in the most effective and informative way to suit your needs.

## Step 2. Explore a subgraph

By clicking on an individual [subgraph](/basics/core-concepts#how-do-i-build-a-subgraph), you'll see only its details:
the connectors belonging to it, and their models and commands.

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/subgraph-visualization.png" alt="Visualization of a subgraph" width="1000px" />

## Step 3. Explore a data source

If you have a high number of [connectors](/connectors/introduction) within a subgraph, it may be easier to view a single
data source's models and commands by clicking on the connector. The UI will focus on this single connector and its
related entities.

## Step 4. Explore a model or command

The console allows you to search for any entity within your supergraph by name. In the example below, we're typing
`Carts` and then selecting the option that's returned under the `experience` subgraph's `pg` connector:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/carts-visualization.png" alt="Visualization of the carts model" width="1000px" />

<br />

From this detailed page, you can see a graph or ERD visualization of an entity, see the GraphQL root fields available,
list all available relationships and permissions, and even execute a sample query!

### Signature

A signature shows what goes into (input) a [model](/supergraph-modeling/models.mdx) or
[command](/supergraph-modeling/commands.mdx) and what comes out (output).

**For Model:**

- Input: Usually empty, as models represent data structures

- Output: The model's type

> Example: `Carts() => Carts` This shows that Carts doesn't take input and returns data of type Carts.

<br />
<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/model-signature.png" alt="Visualization of the carts model" width="1000px" />

<br />
**For Command:**

- Input: Arguments the command needs

- Output: The type of data it returns

> Example: `GetFruits() => [Fruit!]!` This means GetFruits takes no arguments and returns a non-nullable list of
> non-nullable Fruit objects.

<br />

<br />

Signatures help you quickly understand what each resource in your supergraph does and how to use it.

### GraphQL root fields

This section lists the corresponding fields from the GraphQL schema root for a given model or command. These fields
define the entry points for querying your data.

For the `Cart` model, two root fields are available:

- **Select Many:** `app_carts() => Carts` This root field allows querying multiple cart entries.
- **Select Unique:** `app_cartsById(id: String!) => Carts` This root field enables fetching a specific cart by its ID.

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/graphql-root-field.png" alt="Visualization of the carts model" width="1000px" />

<br />

These root fields appear in your GraphQL schema and determine how you can access Cart data in your queries. For example:

```graphql
query {
  app_carts {
    id
    isComplete
  }
}

query {
  app_cartsById(id: "123") {
    id
    isComplete
  }
}
```

The first query uses the "Select Many" field to retrieve multiple carts, while the second uses the "Select Unique" field
to fetch a specific cart by ID.

### Output fields

Output fields define the structure and [types](/supergraph-modeling/types.mdx) of data that can be retrieved from a
model or command. In the example below, for the `Cart` model, the output fields might include: id (Uuid!): A unique
identifier for each cart and other fields as well.

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/fields.png" alt="Visualization of the carts model" width="1000px" />

These fields allow you to query and retrieve specific information about each cart in your application. The `!` indicates
that the field is non-nullable, meaning it will always have a value.

### Arguments

[Arguments](/supergraph-modeling/commands#command-argumentdefinition) are input parameters that can be passed to models
or commands in your GraphQL API. They allow you to filter, sort, or modify the data returned by a query or mutation. In
the context of Hasura's supergraph, arguments play a crucial role in making your API flexible and powerful.

The Arguments table in the Hasura console provides a clear overview of the available arguments for a given model or
command.

### Relationships

[Relationships](/supergraph-modeling/relationships.mdx) define how a model or command connects to other models or
commands in your database. For the Cart model: The `user` relationship links a `cart` to its owner in the `Users` table.
This connection is made through the userId field in the Cart model, which corresponds to the id field in the Users
table.

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/relationships.png" alt="Visualization of the carts model" width="1000px" />

This structure allows you to easily access related user data when working with carts, enhancing the flexibility of your
queries.

### Permissions

[Permissions](/supergraph-modeling/permissions.mdx) define access control for different roles interacting with the model
or command. For the `Cart` model: This configuration means that users with the admin role can view cart information but
cannot create new carts, modify existing ones, or delete them. This read-only access allows admins to monitor cart
activity without making changes.

## Next steps

Now that you have the knowledge to explore your API, let's see how easy it is to
[interact with and test your API](/basics/explore/interact.mdx) using the GraphiQL explorer.
